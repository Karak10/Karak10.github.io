</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 116</h1>
<p> I had to attend my birthday party sadly and I came home pretty late, 
    I could had programmed a little but I didn't feel like it, so I just decided

<h1>Day 120</h1>

    how to create and remove attributes and I also created a 
    project, the porpuse of this project is to create the navigation links at the 
    start of all my pages automatically, and everything worked fine so far, I can now
    add a new page link to all my pages by simply running a function, that's something 
    I wanted to do since going over every single page every time I created a new page was 
    a little tiring, I also made it so the link of the viewed page is replaced with 
    an underlined text, it took me a while to make everything work but at the end I did it.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 121</h1>
<p> I linked the code I created before to all my pages, and did all the preparations needed 
    for the code to work, it took me a while but now everything works fine and 
    through this code I can easily add or remove paragraphs and heading. I also 
    learned how to use window.addEventListener("load", function()) method, and I 
    used this to fix some problems in page seventeen of my notes, since I used window.load 
    wrongly yesterday and some codes didn't work, I also fixed some other stuff in the page 
    like a code I had written a while ago at the second section which for some reason 
    had stopped working, that's all I did today.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 122</h1>
<p> I studied a little about how to make animations but didn't write anything, I decided 
    to take a break for today since the two last days I have been coding much.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 123</h1>
<p> I wrote about how you can create simple animations using JavaScript and created 
    a box moving to right and left in a loop.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 124</h1>
<p> I wrote about how you can use events such as onclic, onload, etc.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 125</h1>
<p> I wrote about Event Propagration and realized that reusing same variety names 
    over and over again in different script elements actually rewrites the previous varieties, 
    the only reason I had no problem with that till now is because the code rewriting the previous 
    varieties was only readen after the previous codes were readen, but now that I edit 
    the DOM with events such as onclick, etc I need to be careful with variety names.
</p>


<hr>

</p>

    JavaScript projects I hadn't yet added.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 128</h1>
<p> A friend of my sister found a little kitten lost at the middle of the road, it was 
    starving which means it's mother probably abadoned it, or maybe something happened to 
    her, she brought it to me since I have been taking care of stray cats in my 
    yard the last two years and she thought I may can help, the kitten is very young
    and thin, if it's mother did abandon it then it's probably also sick, I was too busy taking 
    care of it and didn't have time to program, I did check a little what that ES6 thing 
    I'm gonna learn next is but that's all, anyways, about the kitten, I will try my best 
    to help it, I don't think it's gonna make it, but at least I want to try, and I think

    a small village and we spent almost the whole day there, I didn't bring my computer and 
    coding on phone is a little hard, it's possible but I don't really like it,

    a lot of stuff.
</p>

<hr>

<p>An idiot threw poisoned food all over my neighbourhood, probably because there are 
    dogs that bark some times at night and he wanted to kill them, anyway, the place 
    here is full of stray animals and as you can guess many of them died, including two 
    of my cats, I wasn't feeling very well so I didn't program today, I also wanted 
    to search around for any left poison so that I can clean it up before any 
    other animal dies, if you read this, please don't be like the person who threw the poison, 
    people like this suck.

<p>I learned some stuff about Map object, and also learned a little about 
    iterators.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 150</h1>
<p>I think I finally understood iterators, I wrote a 
    section in my notes explaining what iterators and iterables are, 
    and I feel like going over all that theory was needed, I now feel 
    like I understand iterables way better, and I have a pretty 
    good understanding of iterators too. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 151</h1>
<p>I finished writing about map object in my notes.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 152</h1>
<p>Took a break because firstly, I spent a lot of time preparing camera, programs, etc

    differently the this keyword and when should it be used, also, I 
    understood better classes.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 159</h1>
<p>Today I coded for more than five hours, I spent some time watching 
    youtube videos, and wrote a big section in my notes about asynchronous 
    and synchronous code, how we can make asynchronous code using 
    function callbacks, how if we nest it a lot it gets ugly and 
    finally how we can transform this code into a more 
    readable one using promises, I also learned about async and await 
    keywords of promises but I'm gonna write about that in my notes tomorrow because it got late.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 160</h1>

    I understand them very very well now (I probably don't yet 
    understand them 100% though).
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 163</h1>
<p>I studied and wrote in my notes some stuff about what symbols are, 
    I don't yet fully understand them but I did learn some nice stuff 
    and I now have some basic knowledge about what they are and why 
    they are used.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 164</h1>
<p>I studied and wrote in my notes about parseInt() and parseFloat() methods, 
    together with that, I also learned some stuff about numerical systems such as 
    hexademical, octal, binary, etc, and how we can conver demical numbers 
    to them, this helped me understand the radix property of parseInt() method.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 165</h1>
<p>I studied and wrote in my notes about the array reduce() method, I 
    also learned about how comparison between strings work.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 166</h1>
<p>I watched some YouTube videos about defer and async 
    attribute, and also learned some stuff about modules in 
    JavaScript, however, I didn't study these too much and didn't 
    write anything in my notes becaue I decided to make
    few projects, so for today I made two nice projects.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 171</h1>
<p> Since I finished my JavaScript course yesterday I decided 
to take a break for today. I spen the day 
replaying one of my favorite games (Undertale) which I hadn't played 
for some years now, and I also watched a film with a friend and my siblings.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 172</h1>
<p> I did quite a lot today, now that I'm done with the course 
I mostly scroll through w3schools.com, reading every single thing 
so that I find stuff that were not included in the course 
and add them in my notes. Today, I discovered a new arithmetic operator, 
the exponentiation operator, symbolized with (**), I also learned and wrote about 
bitwise operators, conditional operator and type operators. Lastly, I also 
learned and wrote about the window.print() method that allows you to print 
the page.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 173</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote about the prototype chain, I also 
did a lot of research about other stuff in YouTube, like, 
what's React, what's Node.js, how can I create discord bots, 
and more. 
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 174</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote in my notes 
    about object getters and setters, 
    object property descriptors and about the 
    Object.create() method. 
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 175</h1>
<p> I had too much homework to do and couldn't 
    program today.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 176</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote a lot of stuff about the prototye chain, 
    I searched and understood the prototype chain of arrays, objects, 
    functions, arrow functions, classes, data objects, math objects, set objects, map objects,
    numbers, strings, booleans and symbols, it did take me a while, something more than 
    four hours.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 177</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote more about class prototype chain, about what happens 
    to class methods when they are static and when they are prototype methods, 
    about how they are chained to the prototype chain when one extends the other. 
    I also wrote more about what happens behind the scenes of the class syntax, 
    and remade a class using normal function syntax.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 175</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote in my notes 
    about  obj.propertyIsEnumerable(prop) and obj.hasOwnProperty(prop), 
    I also wrote about extensible, frozen and sealed objects, what are they, 
    how to prevent extensions in an object, freeze it or seal it, and how to check 
    if an object is extensible, frozen or sealed.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 176</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote in my notes 
    about the prototype of promises, about immediately 
    invoked function expressions and I also made an 
    introduction to closures, which I'm gonna continue tomorrow.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 177</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote more about closures in my notes, it took 
    quite some time to do this because some stuff were hard to gasp, for example,
    there was that one loop using setTimeout problem that is usually used for interviews, 
    and it took me a while to fully understand it, but at the end I did, 
    lately I have been spending a lot of time programming, so I'm probably 
    taking a break tomorrow, I have some stupid homework I need to finish 
    by the end of the week so I will try to get some of it done already.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 178</h1>
<p> I didn't do much today, only fixed some stuff in my notes and then 
decided to take a break, I played a great visual novel called Underworld Office,
and started reading a web comic called Awful Hospital, sadly, I was lazy 
and did no homework.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 179</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about function currying, I would do more 
    but since I didn't get any work on my homeword done yesterday and 
    the deadline is in two days I am a little busy with this, both math 
    and programming make me dizzy.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 180</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about console.table, console.trace, console.dir, 
    console.error, console.warn and console.info. I also wrote about the prototype 
    chain of document, window and console.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 181</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about array find(), pop() and shift() methods, 
    I also restudied a little how object destructuring is done.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 182</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about array some(), every() and includes() methods.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 183</h1>
<p> I went hiking with my family and 
    we kind of got lost on a mountain, it's okay though, we made it back, 
    it just took a little longer than expected, and I also was tired, so 
    I decided to take a break and not code today.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 184</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote about how composition can be better than 
    inheritance and created few examples.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 185</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote more about DOM, I wrote about innerText, textContent, 
    querySelector, querySelectorAll, closest, and also corrected some stuff 
    I had written in the past, it turned out methods like element.children or 
    getElementsByClassName, etc do not create an array, but a collection, which does 
    work pretty similar to an array, but they are not linked to the array constructor in the 
    prototype tree, so array methods can't be used on them, to fix that I learned about 
    Array.from() method which can be used to create an array out of the collections. I also 
    learned a little about classList and dataset but I'm gonna learn more 
    about these tomorrow.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 186</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote about dataset and other attribute methods.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 187</h1>
<p> I learned and wrote about all the classList methods.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 188</h1>
<p> I took a break for today, I start playing a cool game called 
    Phoenix Wright something, its pretty cool.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 189</h1>
<p> I learned a lot of stuff about events and how 
    to better use them.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 190</h1>
<p> I recreated my navigation bar so that when you 
    are viewing a CSS page only CSS pages show up at
    the top of the page with a Previous (JavaScript Notes)
    button and a Next (CSS Notes) button, I did the 
    same of course of JavaScript and HTML notes. 
    It took me a while, it was mostly because instead 
    of remaking it all from the start I tried to 
    save time by updating the already made code in 
    weird ways to achieve the wanted result, I'm sure 
    the code could be better written, it's a little 
    ugly, but hey, it works... 
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 191</h1>
<p> I made an extension to the ugly navigation 
    maker code I updated yesterday, this extension 
    looks over the extra pages, which are pages that are 
    not named in order like Notes1, Notes2, etc, it's 
    pages that were created later, like CSS_Extra_1, 
    it's an extra page for CSS I created, if I named it 
    Notes23 that would create problems to the navigation bar creator, 
    and also, it would be weird for Notes23 to be before Notes13, 
    anyway, after the navigation bar creates the links, the extra pages are 
    created, and then an array of those extra link is created, 
    then a loop happens that checks which link matches the 
    viewed page, and replaces it with a fake link, I made 
    it flexible I think, so that means I can use that exact 
    same code for JavaScript notes, CSS notes and HTML notes without a 
    problem, as long as the only thing that changes is 
    the first word of the name of the link, aka CSS_Extra_1, JavaScript_Extra_1, etc, 
    I can simple check the header of the page and take 
    the first word of it, which always is the language I talk about in the page, 
    then I can use it infront _Extra_number, so this 
    works no matter the notes. Anyway, I also learned and wrote 
    about CSS box-sizing property.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 192</h1>
<p>I wrote about CSS variables, JavaScript window.getComputedStyles, 
    getPropertyValue, setPropertyValue and I also made 
    links for all sections in Notes22, Notes17 and the first 
    extra page of my CSS notes.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 193</h1>
<p>I wrote about CSS calc function.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 194</h1>
<p> I created the JavaScript clock project.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 195</h1>
<p> I watched a vide about how to build a sortable drag 
    and drop list, it was a little hard to gasp at first so 
    I watched the video twice, took me around 42 minutes to do 
    so, anyway, I decided I could take a break for today, 
    tomorrow I'm gonna learn more about drag and drop, play 
    around with it and write about it in my notes too.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 196</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes how to create a 
    sortable drag and drop list.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 197</h1>
<p> Today was mostly spent searching for next stuff 
    I want to learn, I will try and study in more depth 
    mouse positions such as clientY, windowY, pageY, etc, 
    I will also learn how to create the drag and drop list I created 
    yesterday for mobile users too, in order to do so I will have 
    to learn more about the touch events that exist. Except from 
    the searching I did I also wrote in my notes about 
    element.getBoundingClientRect() method and how I can use 
    it to get the position of an element reletive to the 
    viewport of the window, and how to get the position 
    of the element relative to the top left corner of the document 
    by adding up the rest of the pixels using window.scrollY and 
    window.scrollX.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 198</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about clientY, pageY, screenY 
    and offsetY.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>Day 199</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about mouseEnter & mouseLeave vs 
    mouseOver vs mouseOut events, about mousedown & mouseup 
    vs click, dblclick and contextmenu events and lastly I learned 
    about mouseover event.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 200</h1>
<p> I wasn't feeling well, I had an annoying headanche so I decided 
    to take a break.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 201</h1>
<p> I wrote in my notes about touch events, I spent a lot 
    of time studying these, however, I still don't feel like 
    I know them good enough, I have to learn them better, and 
    I need to learn how to create swipe, zoom, rotate and other 
    kind of effects, something that's probably going to be hard 
    since it needs math to determine the positions of the touches 
    and the time it took you to move the touches if you want to 
    make swipe faster or slower, etc, I guess there are a lot of things 
    I don't yet know after all, not just for touch events, but for 
    web development in general.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 202</h1>
<p>Today I used touch events to create swipe effect using only pure 
    vanilla JavaScript.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 203</h1>
<p>Today I did a lot of studying actually, I spent a lot of hours studying vectors, I even made a 
    math notes section in my website where I will be adding stuff about math every once in a while. Anyway, 
    after I learned how to work with vectors I tried to make a project, in which I wanted to make a div rotate towards the 
    cursor/touch position, to do so I had to use vectors and calculate the angle that should be rotated, 
    but doing so wasn't as easy as I believed because I faced some problems in the process, you see, websites 
    and math diagrams are not exactly that same, the heigher the mouse is the less the y value is, anyway, this wasn't 
    very hard to solve this problem however, I only needed to find the offset between the div and the mouse cursor by 
    removing the pixels between the top of the document and the position of the cursor from the pixels between the 
    top of the document and the bottom of the div, to find exactly the div from the top of the document to the bottom of the 
    div I had to also calculate the pixels that I scrolled since boundingClientRect gave only the pixels between 
    the top of the window and the div. I wanted to calculate the position of the div right after 
    the page loaded, and I couldn't use clientY and clientX if the div wasn't visible on the window, I also couldn't 
    calculate the pixels using clientY and clientX after the mousemove event triggered 
    because there were some problems that appeared if I did so, from what I understand the boudningClientRect width, and top 
    would change as the div rotated, and this created glitches, anyway, at the end I did it, I also 
    made it redefine the x1 and y1 position whenever the window gets resized, since the div was centered using margin: auto 
    and when the window got resized the x would change. The project ended up pretty well, and I think it helped me 
    improve as a developer, knowing how to work with vectors is actually pretty cool, and I am going to create some more cool 
    projects in the future. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 204</h1>
<p>I decided to relax a little today, lately I have been 
overcoding I believe, yesterday for example I probably spent 
more than 8 hours coding. Anyway, I did do some stuff, 
I just didn't do a lot of stuff, I created a happy face 
which eyes are rotating towards the cursor/touch, 
this makes it seem as if the face looks at the cursor/finger,
it works pretty similarly to the project I made yesterday, but it is cooler, 
plush, I realized how easy it is to make something after you have 
already made it in the past, yesterday it took me a lot time to create 
a simple div rotate towards the mouse, today however I knew what I 
was doing and I had no problem doing it again.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 205</h1>
<p>Today I made the drag and drop list usable for touch screens too, 
I faced some problems so it took me a while but now it works fine 
for both mouse and touch.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>Day 206</h1>
<p>Today I didn't do much, I did some fixes to my notes and made a link for my drag and 
    drop list project, I have been studying hard lately and I had to do 
    some homework so I decided not to code more for the day.
</p>/

<hr>
<h1>Day 207</h1>
<p>Today sucked, my laptop started making annoying fan noises, really loud ones, 
    so I decided to open it and take a look, I have never opened a laptop before 
    so I searched up for intructions online, however, we have this laptop for more than six 
    years, and we have never opened it, because of that, it had a lot of dust, and 
    some parts wouldn't come out easily, the laptop I have is an old lenovo one, 
    and it's not as simple to open as the more modern laptops. The laptop was so bad 
    that a screw inside had melted and I couldn't take everything above the fan off, 
    I still could see the fan and I could lift the layer over the fan and hold it with 
    one hand, so I still tried to fix the fan even if it was a little hard. Anyway, 
    at the end I think I may damaged the laptop more, the touchpad 
    and keyboard won't work for some reason, and the fan became worse, now the laptop doesn't even open 
    and I get a fan error message. I guess the surgery was a failure, now I'm left 
    with no laptop, so things will be a little harder for me, I will try to code with my 
    father's laptop whenever I can, something that will not be very confortable since 
    I won't be able to have it any time I like, I also will try to code with my phone 
    if possible and maybe I will try to fix the laptop I broke, which will probably 
    not happen, perhaps if I'm lucky I can convince my parents to get me 
    a new one.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>208</h1>
<p>I deleted that ugly navigation bar creator code I had written 
and rewrote it from the start, this time it's way more organized and 
simple, this had to be done at some point, and it took me 
quite some time to do because of the different kind of notes I have.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>209</h1>
<p>I wrote about web storage API, I also wrote about how you can 
    convert objects to strings and stringified objects back to real objects
    using JSON.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>210</h1>
<p>Today I wrote about geolocation API.</p>

<hr>
<h1>211</h1>
<p>Today I wrote about canvas, about how to access CanvasRenderingContext2D object using 
    getContext('2d'), and about the following methods and properties of CanvasRenderingContext2D object:
    fillRect, fillStyle, strokeRect, strokeStyle and lineWidth.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>212</h1>
<p>Today I wrote more about canvas, more specifically, I wrote about those following methods: clearRect(x, y, w, h), beginPath(), moveTo(x, y), lineTo(x, y), stroke(), fill() and closePath().</p>

<hr>

<h1>213</h1>
<p>Today I learned and wrote in my notes about bezier curves of Canvas, I also 
    created a background diagrab which I will be able to use to messure the pixels 
    in the canvas, something that took me a while to make using JavaScript loops, and 
    I also learned a little about how to make text in the canvas and a little about arcs, 
    not much though, just little because I needed these for today's notes, I will go more 
    in depth on those stuff another day.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>214</h1>
<p>Today I learned more about arcs, more specifically, I learned about arc() and arcTo() methods.</p>

<hr>
<h1>215</h1>
<p>Today I learned and wrote in my notes about text in canvas, about font, fillText, strokeText, alignText,
    textBaseLine, direction and measureText.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>216</h1>
<p>Today I wrote a little about the proxy object, I wrote about 
    get, set and apply handlers, I was planning to write about 
    more of the handlers but I faced some problems which slowed me down, 
    and because I don't have my own laptop and I use my father's I am coding 
    at night, while everyone sleeps, and it's already 4:00 am, so I guess I can go to sleep and 
    continue tomorrow.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>217</h1>
<p>Today I wrote more about the proxy object, I wrote about and construct 
    handlers, I also wrote about how you can manipulate the parameters given to a method when 
    accessing it using proxy object and I also made two nice projects to demostrate how 
    proxy object can be useful.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>218</h1>
<p>Today I didn't have the chance to program, at morning I was tired so I decided to sleep, 
    and later I tried to do some programming but couldn't do much because I don't have my own laptop 
    anymore, at night I could do some but I decided it would be better if I went to sleep so that 
    I am not tired again the next morning and program then.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>219</h1>
<p>I wrote much about Regular Expressions, I wrote about all assertion special characters. </p>

<hr>
<h1>220</h1>
<p>I wrote about character classes in regular expressions.</p>

<hr>
<h1>221</h1>
<p>I wrote abou groups and ranges in regular expressions, it took me 
    a while, I also learned about some RegExp methods that can be used 
    to reference those groups later in code, there are some stuff I didn't have 
    the chance to talk about yet, because of the limited time I had, it 
    took me more time than expected to learn capture groups because of some problems 
    I faced, but I will learn more tomorrow.

<h1>221</h1>
<p>I took a break today</p>

<hr>
<h1>222</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote in my notes about quantifiers in regular expressions.</p>

<hr>
<h1>223</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote in my notes about regular expressions flags.</p>

<hr>
<h1>224</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about the RegExp object.</p>

<hr>
<h1>225</h1>
<p>Today I wrote about the split() and replaceAll() methods of String object.</p>
</article>

<hr>
<h1>226</h1>
<p>Today I learned about the RegExp.prototype[Symbol.match], 
    RegExp.prototype[Symbol.matchAll], RegExp.prototype[Symbol.replace], 
    RegExp.prototype[Symbol.split] and RegExp.prototype[Symbol.search] methods, now 
    I know how I can create custom behaviors for when I split, match, search or replace strings 
    using regular expressions.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>227</h1>
<p>I took a break for today.</p>

<hr>
<h1>228</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about reflect object today.</p>

<hr>
<h1>229</h1>
<p>I learned a little better reflect object, more specifically I tried and understood 
    the Reflect.construct() method, it's third parameter was a little confusing at first, 
    I also learned about the new.target pseudo property.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>230</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about linear gradients in JavaScript canvas.</p>

<hr>
<h1>231</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about canvas transforms methods, such as 
    rotate, translate, scale, save and restore.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>232</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about lineCap, lineJoin, setLineDash(), lineDashOffset and miterLimit canvas properties.</p>

<hr>
<h1>233</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about globalAlpha method in canvas, I would have done more today 
    but now that schools started I'm facing some difficulties, ever after my laptop broke I started 
    using my father's laptop to code, so far I used to do my coding at morning during online school or 
    at night when everyone was sleeping, since at day my father uses it a lot, now that 
    we started doing school normally I can't code during morning anymore, and at night I'm kind of 
    tired since I wake up early every day, because of that it's hard for me to get much coding done, I am trying
    to do as much coding as possible during day, but some days I don't get much time 
    to use the laptop. I will try coding on my phone I guess and see what happens from now on.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>234</h1>
<p>I did an introduction to images in my canvas notes, there are quite some some stuff 
    to lern about images in JavaScript. I also creted an extra page for my HTML notes and 
    edited the code I had written to create the navigation bar to make it check 
    for the extra pages too like it does for CSS. Anyway, I also wrote about the crossorigin HTML 
    attribute. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>235</h1>
<p>I wrote more about images, how to create an image object using JavaScript and 
    how to make sure all images have loaded before the code to draw the images on the canvas 
    execute. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>236</h1>
<p>I wrote about the drawImage() method and all it's nine parameters.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>237</h1>
<p>I wrote about imageSmoothingEnabled property, and just that, because 
    I didn't get to use the laptop much today, luckily the other laptop I broke 
    is going to get fixed soon, till then I will try my best to code as much as possible, tomorrow 
    we finish school early so I will probably get few hours with the laptop at morning, and 
    I'm going to learn more about the Canvas, probably about clever ways I can animate the canvas 
    and maybe some more properties and methods if I discover any.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>238</h1>
<p>I wrote about Window.requestAnimationFrame() method and I also created a really 
    cool project on canvas, I created 100 circles moving around randomly that change direction 
    when they hit the edges, and all that was done with a really cool, small and clear code, it took 
    me a while because I faced some difficulties but I think it really helped me get 
    more confortable with canvas.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>239</h1>
<p>I created a canvas project using event listeners, it took me a lot of hours to make 
    because I had some problems, I made it better than in the tutorial, I also made it 
    support multi touches, it's basically the project I created yesterday but the circles also 
    scale up when mouse is hovered over them within a wanted range or if you touch within the wanted range, 
    I also made other changes, such as their radius and color which now are determined randomly, and 
    I also had to change the if else statements that check whether or not to change the direction 
    of dx and dy, due to some problems that would occur if circles were scaled when being near 
    the edges of the canvas. Anyway, I think I did a pretty good job today, coded a lot and 
    I am sure this helped me improve my skills.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>240</h1>
<p>The project I created later was made on my phone, so I had to get the code on 
    my laptop, fix the spacing since in phone it couldn't fit and it was structured weird, 
    and then I had do do some improvements to the code, I added mouse events, and also changed the 
    touch events code, before the canvas would take the whole screen on my phone so I didn't need to do much, but 
    on my laptop on my page the canvas does not take the whole screen, so to find the offset from the edge 
    of the canvas and the position of the mouse I had to also get the position of the canvas and do the math. 
    Anyway, it took me a while but I did it, and I would do more but I didn't have much time to use the laptop.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>241</h1>
<p>Today I coded really late at night, around 1:30 am, I wrote an explanation 
    below the project I created the other days explaining what each part of the code does, 
    I also made a page for this project and added it's link to my projects home page, and I also wrote 
    my diary, since I hadn't filled the last three days due to problems. Except from that, 
    I also watched a video about the next thing I'm gonna learn about canvas, which is how to add 
    gravity.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>242</h1>
<p>Today I learned and wrote about how to create gravity on canvas, 
    it was pretty cool and I'm sure this helped me improve my canvas skills a lot.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>243</h1>
<p>Today I did an introduction to collisions in Canvas, and then I spent 
    the rest of my morning studying physics, I really wish I had paid more attention while 
    in school, who would imagine I would need to learn all those stuff now. As I am improving as 
    a developer I start to realize more and more how useful math and physics can be in my career, so 
    I am being trying to learn other stuff than just programming too, I could just copy paste the 
    wanted function and have my realistic colission added to all my balls, however, if I want to 
    one day become a great programmer I should learn and understand the code, copy pasting should not be 
    a solution, and the knowledge I gain now will be useful for my future, therefore, I will try to study and 
    learn better the physics behind the code tomorrow too, and I will probably merge my math notes section with 
    physics since I rearly add stuff there, anyway, I will try my best so that I am able to create that collision project 
    soon and also write a detailed explanation of what the code does.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>244</h1>
<p>Today I wrote in my notes about physics of an elastic collision, and I also 
    made a project of a collision happening on the x axis, tomorrow I will try to 
    learn more about how I can find the velosity of two particles when they collid
    with an angle, I think I need to rotate the axis or something, but I will learn more tomorrow, 
    I already spent a lot of time studying today.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>245</h1>
<p>Today I learned and wrote about 2D elastic collisions and also created 
    a project with two circles. Tomorrow I will probably create the main project 
    I wanted to create using collisions since I think I'm ready to do that and I will 
    probably continue with the next video in the canvas tutorial course I'm watching.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>246</h1>
<p>Today I learned how to randomly position circles on the canvas without overlapping, and also 
    how to detect collision for multiple circles at the same time. With this and the knowledge I gained the 
    last two days about physics of elastic collisions I were able to create the project of the tutorial course 
    I'm watching, so tomorrow I can finally leave collisions behind for now and move to the next lesson.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>247</h1>
<p>I edited all the canvas animations I have in my page so that they only run 
once they are visible on the screen, I also watched a tutorial about circual movement 
and I will write about this tomorrow since today I have much homework to do and I also 
would like to relax a little.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>248</h1>
<p>I learned and wrote about circual motions in my notes.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>249</h1>
<p>I added mouse interactivity the the circular movement project I 
    created yesterday so that the circle is slowly dragged towards the mouse 
    when hovered over the canvas.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>250</h1>
<p>Today I learned about getImageData() method, and the pixels array, it took me a while, but at the 
    end I understood it, and also created a color picker project which 
    allows you to hover your mouse over a colorful canvas and the colors you are hovering over 
    are displayed on a div. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>251</h1>
<p>I learned about putImageData() and toDataURL() methods, I also created
a project that allows you so change filters of an image, if for example you selecte 
"Grayscale" the image changes to a black and white image, and if you choose Inverted the image's colors 
get inverted, it was a nice and fun project.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>252</h1>
<p>I made the background of the circual movement project I made the other day transparent 
by creating the trail effect using getImageData() and putImageData(), I then tried to 
use the canvas on my homepage so that the canvas takes the whole page but there were some problems with 
the iframes that I need to get fixed.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>253</h1>
<p>I learned how to create custom events and also fixed some of the iframe problems 
I had yesterday, now I try to find a way call a function whenever a new page is opened inside the iframe, 
I'm searching for an event that may exist or any tricks I could use.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>254</h1>
<p>I solved the problem with the iframes, and then I also created pages for
all the previous projects I had made including that last one 
I just fixed and added the links to those pages in my 
projects home page. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>255</h1>
<p>I took a break for today and decided to relax and try to finish 
a game called Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney which I had left for a while now 
at the last chapter.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>256</h1>
<p>I watched the next video about canvas which taught me how to make 
waves effect, I only watched it, didn't fully understand it yet or talk about it 
in my notes, I also learned a little stuff about JavaScript packages, github and 
also watched an introduction to terminal commands, I will write about terminal commands 
tomorrow in my notes since it's pretty useful to know those stuff, and some basic knowledge about 
the terminal will be needed if I want to be able to download packages or later learn how to 
use git. Except from that I also redecorated my page a little, changed some colors, the font family, 
and some other stuff, I also created a new category of notes called extra notes, which will 
include notes about tools, skills and other programming related stuff that just don't fit in any 
other category. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>257</h1>
<p>I learned what is a terminal, what is a shell and how to use bash on windows 10 with Windows Subsystem for Linux and Ubuntu.
From bash I learned a bunch of basic commands that allow me to view and manipulate files. Except from that I also 
spent a lot of my day searching online for information about a various things, such as Node Package Manager, Node.js and 
others. I also started learning a little computer science, nothing seriously hard, I just watch some videos in 
my free time or read some articles, I just want to understand computers, networks and the web in a bigger depth.    
</p>

<hr>
<h1>258</h1>
<p>I learned how to use live server extension on Visual Code Studio, and I also learn some basics about how to use 
    Node Package Manager, I faced a lot of problems in the process, but I did learn it a lot better. I'm still not 
    done with NPM, and I will probably try and rewrite the NPM notes so that they are better organized and in more detail 
    now that I have a better understanding of NPM, a problem I am still trying to solve is that I cannot use npm commands with 
    bash and I have to change to cmd shell, but I will try and find a solution for that tomorrow.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>259</h1>
<p>I watched a 45 video about NPM and started rewriting my NPM notes in much more details, I learned more 
    about package.json, how to edit default answers, dependencies, dev-dependencies, local and global packages, versioning, 
    NPM scripts and also versioning. Tomorrow I will try to successfuly import my first package with ES6 import 
    syntax, but I will probably need an extension to host a local server for me or else import won't work.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>260</h1>
<p>Today I tried to figure out how to use import on modules installed with NPM, I still 
can't find how to make it work though, so I asked people online and wait for an answer. 
I also found out how to use NPM with bash and wrote about it in my notes.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>261</h1>
<p>Today I organized the files of my notes, I created folders 
to categorize the files, and a folder to put in all the images. 
This was a lot of work because after doing that I had to 
find every place the files have been referenced to and change the 
source to their new path, to do that I used find and replace 
option of VSC together with some knowledge about regular expressions 
that I have from when I studied regular expressions some time ago. 
Anyway, it took a while, but at the end I did it, there were problems 
I faced too, like images not being found or broken link, I found 
a really cool site however which checked my page for me and found 
all unfound sources and this helped me a lot to spot the problems and solve them.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>262</h1>
<p>I took a break and finally finished Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney trilogy, 
they were three great games, and I will probably play the next game called 
Apollo Justice at some point later, maybe in summer if I have the time.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>263</h1>
<p>Today I learned about webpack and parcel, I only learned a little about them, 
    I still don't know how to use them, but I will tomorrow probably start learning how to 
    use parcel since webapck is a little hard. I also made an introduction to module 
    bundlers in my notes where I spoke about what module bundlers are and what they do.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>264</h1>
<p>Today I spoke about parcel and how it works, I faced some problems however and didn't manage 
    to finish it. 
</p>

<hr>
<h1>265</h1>
<p>I solved the problems about parcel that I couldn't solve yesterday and I also 
    learned about the is() pseudo class of CSS.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>266</h1>
<p>I learned how to use dat.GUI package, and also, I learned a trick I can use to 
    only bundle the JavaScript files I want to use the package in without bunding 
    the HTML document too, something I needed since my HTML document actually references 
    quite a lot of files, like images, and other stuff and I didn't want it to bundle everything, 
    it would throw up errors if it did and it would be ugly in general. I find a lot of issues 
    through today's programming, which I solved, so I surely did improve.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>267</h1>
<p>I learned how to make sine waves, I didn't finish the tutorial yet because 
I didn't have enough times but I'm pretty near to finishing it.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>268</h1>
<p>I fixed the notes I had written about how to use dat.gui, I just found out 
you can easily just bundle the JavaScript file so the stuff I had wrote before 
were kind of stupid, therefore I went and rewrote the section. I also finished
writing about sine waves.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>269</h1>
<p>I remade the sine waves project in SoloLearn, and 
I also watched the next video in my canvas course.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>270</h1>
<p>I didn't do much today, I only tried to understand 
a little better what typed arrays are, and I also figured 
out how to solve a problem I have been experiencing with 
trial effect. I also wrote in my notes about how to 
get the opacity value of a pixel.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>271</h1>
<p>I learned how to use perlin noise package to create controlled 
randomness and made a project in which two snakes, one blue and one 
red move around the canvas randomly.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>272</h1>
<p>I learned how to create fireworks on the canvas.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>273</h1>
<p>I learned how to make a light saber on the canvas.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>274</h1>
<p>I learned about the audio object in JavaScript.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>275</h1>
<p>I worked all day on a new project, I tried and 
created my own custom audio controlls, the results were 
pretty cool, the controls work fine, you can start the audio, 
pause, turn off and on the volume, there is a timer, 
and even a progress bar which you can move back and forth 
to change audio's position.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>276</h1>
<p>I took a break for today.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>277</h1>
<p>I copy pasted the audio project I made the other day 
in my projects page, there were some problems however that 
appeared because the getBoundingClientRect() would measure the 
top of the controls after the page loaded and so there would be problems 
now that you can scroll, anyway, in order to fix that I decided 
to compare mouse position and element's position relatively to 
the top of the document and not the top of the viewport.
I would had done more today but I felt a little bad.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>278</h1>
<p>I finished the next canvas project in my course, only 
one is left and then there is a 2 hours tutorial I have to 
watch about how to create my first game in canvas.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>279</h1>
<p>Lately I haven't been sleeping very welll, usually I hardly get 5 hours 
of sleep per day, and that happens because I sleep very late, and wake up 
very early for school and also programming. Anyway, because of that, this 
morning my head was hurting a lot, and I was very tired so I decided to sleep, 
I knew that like that I couldn't get any work done. I did manage to write 
about shadow properties in canvas and also I watched the next tutorial in my 
canvas course later today but that's all I did, I was planning 
to actually get over with the last project so I can start working on my first game 
but my bad habits are effecting my productivity, from now on I guess I will 
try to sleep more so that I can be more productive.
</p>

<hr>
<h1>280</h1>
<p>I created Galactic Light Trails project in canvas.</p>

<hr>
<h1>281</h1>
<p>I starting watching the last tutorial in the canvas course I'm watching in 
youtube, this one is a big tutorial, it is two hours long, and it teaches me how to 
make my first game. So, at this point I already have the knowledge to create games on my 
own, but there are many tricks and tips I can gain from those kind of tutorials to make 
my code better.</p>

<hr>
<h1>282</h1>
<p>I remade the galactic light trails project in SoloLearn, 
it's something I do, after finishing a project instead of just copy pasting 
the code in SoloLearn to save it in my account I like to remake it on my phone 
out of scratch when I'm bored, it's good practice, the fact that I am able to create those problems 
again without the need to look at the tutorials prove I have learned and understood 
the code. I also started working on my game project, so far I have built the player, 
who can move around with the arrows and wasd buttons,
I have made it so particles can also be fired when you click, 
I still haven't worked on enemies and collisions however
so there are a lot of stuff that need to be done before the game is finished.</p>

<hr>
<h1>283</h1>
<p>I added enemies and collisions to the game</p>

<hr>
<h1>284</h1>
<p>I spent a lot of time trying to imrpove the collisions, 
at the end I feel satisfied about the results. I also spent 
a lot of hours writing in my notes a big explanation of what 
the code does after I was done.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>285</h1>
<p>I made bullet collisions, added health to enemies and made 
them die when their health reaches 0, and I also added health to the player, 
a score counter, a high score counter and a game over screen.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>286</h1>
<p>Fixed the collisions a little, organized the code, added 
a lot of comments that explain what each part does, I also created 
three different types of zombies that spawn randomly, made the health bar 
decrease more smoothly and I also made blood to spawn whenever an enemy is hit, 
which then stays on the floor and is redrawn in every iteration using getImageData 
and putImageData, this is cool because that means I don't need to keep adding 
the blood particles in an array, something that would effect the performance a lot, 
by using getImageData and putImageData I can also remove the blood particles from the array 
when their animation movement is done. Tomorrow I plan to write an explanation of everything 
new I added to the code in my notes, and I want to also fix the healthbar of the enemies 
so that it always is drawn over every other particle and also I want to make the enemies 
explode after they have died and maybe create waves so that the game is more entertaining 
and medkit to heal, I was also thinking about adding a knife and maybe getting 
some premade character sprites online to make the game look better, if I decide to do that 
however I will also need to make the player and zombies rotate while moving, I think 
it shouldn't be that hard if I use the rotate method though.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>287</h1>
<p>I fixed the healthbar and made the enemies explode when they 
die, I also fixed a bug with the walls and decorated the game, added black background 
and other nice stuff.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>288</h1>
<p>I wrote more comments in the code, copy pasted it in my notes, 
and also copy pasted it in a paragraph so that the code is visible on screen, 
then I added spans around  every comment to make their background white 
and spans around everything new in the code to make the background orange.
I also removed any white spaces I had missed and I am ready to write 
the explanation tomorrow.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>289</h1>
<p>I started writing an explanation of everything new I added 
to the code, and also learned how to create a glitch effect, 
which I will probably later use on the game.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>290</h1>
<p>I finished with the explanation 
and will probably start working on adding 
some touch mechanics to the game, I want to create 
a joystick to move around and shoot.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>291</h1>
<p>I decorated my game, learned about patterns that can 
be added as fill styles and used a grass sprite to make the floor cooler. I 
made the enemies colorful and their blood as well, so that it looks as if 
you are drawing while shooting them. I also created levels and waves counters, 
and an exps bar, which however I still haven't made functional. Lastly, I created 
a move joystick for the player which makes the player move faster as you drag 
the joystick farther from it's center and slower as you move it to it's center.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>292</h1>
<p>Today it took me the whole day to figure out a way to identify the touches so that 
I create a shoot joystick and make it so I can keep track of the touch which is dragging the move joystick 
and the touch which is dragging the shoot joystic. At the end I figured out a way, and finished 
the shoot joystick. All that's left is to add those joysticks in the game since I created them on my 
phone as a different project.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>293</h1>
<p>I added the joysticks to my game, made some changes since the canvas in my page does not 
take the whole page and I needed to calculate the offset of clientX and the left side of the canvas, 
and of course the same for clientY and the top of the canvas. Anyway, at the end I made it work.
Then I fixed an issue I had with pageIsViewed variable, for some reaon enemies would spawn 
when page was not viewed, but I fixed that. I also changed the way I make the enemies dissapear, 
I did that to fix a bug that could occur and enemies who were not hit to death disappeared, this 
fixed the problem and made the code clearer, I also rewrote the old system in the notes I had written before 
to that new one and change the explanation I had written. Another thing I did was to upload the background 
image in dropbox and update my code so that if the image is not founded 
it uses the link to the image I uploaded in dropbox as an alternative src
to the image object I use to set the floor, with this I then could upload my code in 
SoloLearn and the image would appear there too.  
I have noticed some more bugs that need to be fixed, 
in SoloLearn for some reasons enemies do not spawn if I don't click the screen first, I may as well 
just remove pageIsViewed and scrollIntoView from being checked there if I don't find a solution, 
but I will probably do anyway. There was also another problem with the shoot joystick, for some 
reason it can set the interval multiple times, and a lot of bullets shoot together, 
so that's something that needs to be fixed. Tomorrow I will try and fix those bugs, and 
I want to also start working on the exps bar, levels counter, and create some kind of 
automated waves that increase, and make it so that the bigger wave the more the enemies, or something 
like that, I will also need to create an enemies counter to count how many enemies are left till 
next wave, there are basically a lot of things to be done, I also need to add sound effects 
and music at some point.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>294</h1>
<p>Today I fixed a bug with the joystick that did not calculate the full speed when fully dragged, I also fixed 
another problem that I made, it was a stupid mistake but now it is no more. Except from that I also changed the enemies 
dying system again just a little, and I organized the code by removing all the code inside the aniate function and 
adding it as seperate functions that I used inside the animate function if certain conditions are met, this makes it easier to read. 
I also created the exps system, and made it so that as you level up the exps needed to reach the next level increase, 
and I also made an effect that appears when you have leveled up. I don't know if I'm gonna keep it because it isn't very pretty and it was really rushed, 
I basically used the explosions constructor but made it so it's text that explodes from where the player is and I made it so 
the texts are randomly generated from an array of many different texts, such as "Level up!", "Congratulations!", etc.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>295</h1>
<p>I did a lot of coding today again, I fixed a problem with the healthbar, made it better, I also fixed 
a problem with collisions. I improved the level up effect, and created a maxExps variable which I increase 
every time the player levels up, this makes a much better level up system than the one I used before. I also 
made it so levels and exps are reset when game resets. I then fixed some code, removed the pause screen and 
recreated it over again, this time I made it an actual pause screen and not just some text writing "pause" like before, 
I created a button constructor which creates buttons, and made a really pretty pause screen, with the pause screen 
I also didn't need the pageIsViewed variable anymore, so I changed a lot of that code, and made it much simplier, 
which should probably also solve whatever the issue with SoloLearn was the other day, I still haven't checked. Anyway, 
I also made the pause screen to work for touches, which took some extra time to do, I still need to create a 
pause button so that the pause screen is accessible on mobile, for pc you can access it by pressing esc, changing 
window, or scrolling the canvas out of view. So, tomorrow, I will make a button to access the pause screen, 
and I also will try to start working on a starting screen, then I want to soon start adding sound effects, 
and after that I can create an option page so that users can change music and sounds volume, and maybe turn 
off effects for better performance, then I want to create waves, and an actual ending, so, all those stuff will take 
a while to be finished.

<hr> 

<h1>296</h1>
<p>I made a home screen, and I also learned how to add costum fonts to my page</p>

<hr> 

<h1>297</h1>
<p>I made the options page and made it so the player can turn off and on the blood, explosion and level up effects, 
I also changed a little the way pages load, and made it easier to read.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>298</h1>
<p>I made it so I can easily add multiple images to my code, and
did nothing else for today because I had to study for a math test, 
tomorrow I will also study but I will try to do some more programming
too if I can.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>299</h1>
<p>I started working on a dialog constructor to use for 
dialogs, I created a waves system, and made it so the 
enemies that will be spawned in each wave are calculated and shown 
on the left of the screen, and decrease as you kill the enemies so 
that the player knows how many enemies are left till next wave.
I also learned and wrote in my notes about how to craete 
a text wrapper in canvas.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>300</h1>
<p>I managed to create a function that creates a dialog, it types the letters on a specified speed,
wraps the text and works pretty fine. Tomorrow I want to start working on the story.</p>

<hr> 

<h1>301</h1>
<p>Due to some reaal life problems I did not manage to do anything today</p>

<hr> 

<h1>302</h1>
<p>I fixed a problem with the dialogs, now if the player leaves the game before the dialog has finished, 
when he restarts the game the dialog will also restart and the interval that was typing the dialog will also
stop so it doesn't continue to add letters. I did the same for enemies, I hadn't realised that before but 
there was a bug and if you left and rejoined the game the interval spawning the enemies would not clear and 
another interval would begin, making the enemies spawn faster and spawning more than the max enemies. I want
to hope that everything works fine now, but this project has gotten so big that it's hard to predict what kind of bugs
may exist, that's why experimenting is important. I also changed completely the way images are loaded, 
to load them I used promises, it took me a lot of time to make that happen, because at first I tried something
else before I decide to go restudy promises and use them instead, after studying them a little I made it so
that I can easily insert new images to the code in the future using a simple function, and made it so it checks 
wether the src is valid, and if not use an alternative link, then I made it so only after all the promises have been
resolved the game starts.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>303</h1>
<p>I started working on the story line of the game, I made an easy to use code structure in which I
will easily can add dialogs and stuff to the story, and finished the tutorial part.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>304</h1>
<p>I started adding sound effects to the game, I searched for the right ones and
added a sound effect I liked for the bullets when they are shot and one for the letters when they
are typed in dialogs, this created some more problems which I had to solved of course like always, and
I had do do some modifications to the dialog code so that the sound effect plays and stops playing 
correctly. I would actually do more but I have to study Physics for a test I am writing at school.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>304</h1>
<p>I worked some more on the sound effects, fixed some small problems,
like, for example, the dialog sound effect wouldn't stop playing when the plaeyr
left the game, and stuff like that. I didn't really do much more because I spend the whole
day continuing my studies on physics for the test I am writing tomorrow, I got to get a little
more serious with school, for a lot of reasons, firstly, Math and Physics are actually very interesting
and are also very useful for programming, and secondly, I want to graduate and get in
a programming school or something after to learn more about combuters and programming and
also to get a certificate which will be useful when I need to find a job, I also want to do this 
so that I win some more time before I go to the army, so that I can learn some more advanced
web development and be able to get a job by the time I have to start living alone.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>305</h1>
<p>I added music to my game, one for the start screen and one for when you actually play, 
I made a screen that opens before you enter the start screen, so that the player can
click to enter the game, this was needed because I could not just make the music start playing
on it's own without DOM being interacted. I then worked on the options screen, I made
a new constructor that creates volume bars which I made so that you can drag them to change
the volume of the music and sound effects, everything works well, I give each sound a max volume
and make it so you can controle the percentage of the volume from those bars, however,
I still haven't worked at all on touch events, with mouse everything works fine, and with little
effort I should be able to actually make it work for touches too, but I am a kinf of
perfectionist you see so I am probably gonna work some more on it, and make it so both 
volume bars can simultaneously be dragged at the same time, and to do that I will basically just need 
to refresh a little my memory and read some old code, since I had done the same thing with the joysticks,
it had actually took me a lot of time to make the joysticks the way they are but I had ended up to a nice
conclusion about how to keep track of the touches, I only need to remember a little exactly how it works
so that I can decide wether I should remake this for the volume bars or I can actually some how
add some code in the touch events I previously made, and make it work for both joysticks and
volume bars, I really need to read it though because my memory is foggy and the project has got
pretty big by now, I really want to finish with it as soon as possible so that I can move on to
other things.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>306</h1>
<p>I made it so that the dialogs pause when game pauses, I also made it stops when the page loses focus.
I fixed a bug with the shoot function that could set the interval multiple times if clicked very fast, I used
that new trick with intervals I discovered before. I also fixed a bug with the images, the images if first src did
not load could be set to be the pattern of the game before the new src has loaded, now it is fixed. I also
finished with the volume bars, made the touch events and they work pretty well, and I also added the game in SoloLearn
to test multy touches, seems to have no problem, there I also discovered a bug in SoloLearn, because the project needs to be
focused in order for the key events to work, and I used preventDefault in a click event when clicked outside the project you couldn't
focus back, I now fixed this. One new problem exists though, the size and position of stuff need to be made
so they are relative to the size of the canvas, since many things exceed the screen of the phone, and I want
the game to be playable for all screens.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>307</h1>
<p>I didn't do anything today, I had a lot of math homework, and also I decided since this is the last
day before easter holidays begin should take a little break and relax so that I can start coding a lot from tomorrow, 
every single day, and night, since without school I will be getting enough sleep to be able to stay up late at night and code.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>308</h1>
<p>Today I decided to work some more on the game graphics, I wanted to add a face to the player and the enemies so
that they are not just circles, I wanted them to feel more alive. After I found the images, and found a way to convert their
background to invisible, I added them to the game, and realised than after decreasing their size to the size of the player
they got very pixelated, and lost their quality, something I didn't like. Luckily, I had studied a lot about SVG before when
I was still a beginner, however, I can't say I feel comfortable with it, since I haven't touched it
for months, and from what I remember I didn't have the best experience working with it in the past.
So, instead of sitting down and redrawing everything on my own, I decided to search in google for an SVG convertor,
a site that could perhaps convert those images I had to SVG automatically, and luckily for me, there was one that did
just that, and I converted the images. Another problem appeared however, the convertor wasn't perfect,
it did convert the images to SVG, however, the eyes and the mouth which were both white in the images were not filled,
and so they were invisible, something I didn't like. To fix that, I downloaded inkscape, a really nice program
that allows you to easily draw SVG without having to go through the SVG hell I went through back in the days
when I wanted to hand write everything, I had never learned to use that program, so I had to do some
research but it didn't take me long to find out a way to create simple paths, after that, all I had to do
was to draw paths for the eyes and mouths of the faces and fill them with the colors I wanted.
So, at the end, I added a face to the player, and to the normal enemies, I want to actually find and
create different faces for each type of enemy, to make the game seem better, since if every monster had the
same face that would be boring, but I will do this tomorrow.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>309</h1>
<p>Spent a lot of hours working on game sizing and positioning flexibility so
that buttons, and other stuff in the game and sized and positioned relatively to the
canvas's size so that when the canvas size changes they change too. I haven't done this
the perfect way, not the way I would have liked to do this at least, I was thinking about
going over all the constructors I have made, for the buttons for example, and add a loop that
checks if the buttons exceed the width of the canvas, and make it so the loop repeats it self
again and again decreasing the size of the button till the button fits, this however
would require some time, and then I would had to also have to do some other stuff, since it would
probably effect the hover animation I have made, and I would also have to add some more properties
to the object constructor since I would need to make it so that I can define how much
space I want between the button and the edges of the canvas, and also all this would only
apply for the buttons, I then would had to make something similar for the volume bars,
and then something similar for the joy sticks, it would take some time to do all this.
Because of all those reasons, I approached this a different way, I decided to define
the sizes and position of stuff relatively to the canvas's size, so that for example, I make it
so that a button is always positioned 10% of the pixels of the height of the canvas,
I used those kind of tricks to size and position everything, and it seems to work good enough,
for normal sizes at least, since when screen gets too small things do get a little ugly,
I did however define a max width, so that buttons cannot get extremely big for big sizes.
Anyway, there do are a lot of stuff I still gotta do, so it will take me a while to finish the game.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>310</h1>
<p>I uploaded the face images online and added the links to be used as alternative sources if the image files
are not found, that's so that I can later post the game in SoloLearn without having to change the code. I also
discovered a bug with the touch events, after I changed the interval that makes the bullets appear I forgot to
make it stop when the shoot joystick gets deactivated, now it's fixed. I also added the game in SoloLearn, to see
if the changes I made yesterday are good, after fixing some bugs I missed yesterday everything seemed to work fine,
except the player, enemies, and stats, which have to yet be sized as well, the game also seemed a little laggy
in SoloLearn, but that could be for a dozen of reasons, first of all, the player and enemies are pretty big compared
to the screen size so it makes the game seem a little weird in the first place, also, there was the speech text
happening together with the enemies, after the game is over the dialogs will actually appear only when no enemies
are alive, so the interval that creates the dialog will not effect the gameplay. My phone also isn't the best,
so that could also be a reason.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>311</h1>
<p>I made it so the player, enemies, stats are also sized and positioned relatively to the screen, and
fixed some other problems too. Then I searched for ways I could improve the performance and found some,
so I spent some time changing the code, to improve the performance, one thing I did for example was to
remove all those canvas.save() and canvas.restore() methods I was using, since they were a lot and they
were being called again and again very fast, something that surely effected the performance, since those methods
save and restore all different kind of transform properties that exist in canvas, even though you may only need
to restore one or two. After I added the game to SoloLearn everything seemed to be fine.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>312</h1>
<p>I created a pause button that can be used to access the pause screen, either by clicking it or by
touching it, and the reason I needed this was because touch screen users had no way of pausing the game before.
I also created two game over screens, one that appears if you have shot at least one enemy and one that appears if
you didn't shoot any, the one that appears if you didn't shoot anyone is the good ending, the other is the medium ending,
the ending you get if you complete the game will be the bad ending, I also added music for those two endings I created.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>313</h1>
<p>I took a break for today.</p>

<hr> 

<h1>314</h1>
<p>I created the credits screen, where I write a few stuff about the game, how it was inspired by Pony Island, and I also mention that the music and images are not mine.
Now that I'm done with everything I can actually start working on the gameplay to finally finish the project.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>315</h1>
<p>I worked on the story, finished the first five waves, with the dialogs, monster types to spawn in each wave, and all those stuff I wanted to do.
I also fixed a bug in credits screen.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>316</h1>
<p>I went to my grandma's village to celebrate easter together and spent the whole
day there, I did want to code a little at night when I returned but I was tired, since
I had only slept like 3 hours last night.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>317</h1>
<p>I made it so all buttons in pause screen have the
same width, no matter the size of the text inside them, and 
I also worked on the story, finished half of it.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>318</h1>
<p>I finished with the story, and started working on the ending scene, which as it seems will take a while to be made. I also searched and found sound effects that I may use later.</p>

<hr> 

<h1>319</h1>
<p>I didn't program today, because I was feeling terrible, this probably has been the worst day of my life, I have been
taking care of a kitten for five months now, she always sit by my window and keeps me company, and I also took here inside a lot,
she was like a daughter to me, that's how much I cared about her, but the past two days she has been missing, I already had
started worrying from yesterday, since she always was there, on the window, every day, waiting to be fed, but today
I'm convinced I will probably never see her again, and that's because yesterday, and today too, I went out and looked for her, but didn't
find her anywhere. I am trying to get over the fact that I'm probably never gonna see her again and start feeling better,
it's not the first time I lose a cat, I knew I shouldn't get too attached to them, but I did anyway, and now I have
to pay the price. The worst thing is that I did not find a body, and don't know what happened to her, if she is dead, if
she is trapped somewhere, if she is dying, I just want to know, I know the chances are small, but I hope someone
just found her, thought she was friendly and took her to his house, or I hope she is just traveling aroudn and will
come back, but what are the chances, really, she doesn't even know how to find food on her own.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>320</h1>
<p>I had to change the way that blood is being saved and redrawn on the canvas, so that I do not save the whole background,
but only the blood, to do that, I added the background using CSS, so that I only save the blood pixels when I was getImageData(),
I actually had tried doing this another way, but didn't work, so till I get this done a lot of time had passed. Anyway, after 
I got this done, I made it so when the ending scene starts playing, the blood changes to red, and the cute grass backgroudn changes to
scary roads, to build up the atmosphere for the ending, now I have to add music, and work some more on the ending scene,
I actually want to make police cars that go around the player, and then make it so the ending text appears, with
names of people that you killed, which will actually be real people I find in google, anyway, this will take some time,
but I will try to be quick and finish it. Oh, also, I fixed a little bug with the createButtons and createVlumeBars functions, they
could run before the font loads, and that would create a bug with the spacing, so I made it so they run again after the player enters the game.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>321</h1>
<p>I created a different face for the player when the ending scene plays, also, I started working on the police officer cars, and to make them I decided to actually use some of that math I'm learning
in school, because why not, since I learn them lets make them useful at least, I basically wanted to make it so I can pass destinations to
the car object, and make it so the car moves to each destination, one after another, but I wanted it to rotate towards the destination,
and I didn't want the y to be finished before the x, I basically wanted it to move in a straight line, so I used my knowledge on lines 
that I am beeing studying all this time in school, so that I can increase x, and then find the y which will keep the car on the line formed by it's x,
and the destination it is heading to. I was doing this well, however, because I'm stupid, I made a mistake with the angle,
and it took me all night to figure out what was it that I was doing wrong, anyway, I basically wasted all night making no progress,
but the good news is, the next day, after I woke up, I actually realised what the problem was and solved it. 
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>322</h1>
<p>I fixed the problem with the line that I had yesterday, and started working more on the cars, I wanted to make it
so that I give them a starting degree and position, and a set of destinations, and I wanted to make it so that it somehow
determines wether it is faster to turn clockwise or counter clockwise towards the destination it needs to go, and make it so
when it turns the wanted degrees it then stops turning and starts driving, this complexity wasn't really required, not for what
I want to do, however, the whole reason I am being making this game in the first place is to learn, and get used to working
on big and complicated projects, so I wanted to make something cool, anyway, I made a lot of mistakes in the process, stayed awake
all night, and didn't finish it yet.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>323</h1>
<p>After a lot of tries I finished the cars, what have I learned from this? That I'm a total idiot, since
it took me so much time to make and I made so many stupid mistakes, however, I also learned that some times,
it's okay it add few extra if else statements to your code, trying to make small complex code isn't always
the best solution, not if you are stupid like me at least, much of the mistakes I made were because I was 
trying to figure out ways to get the wanted result without writing a lot of lines of code, in the end,
I realised it would had been way faster if I had written down all possible
scenarios that could occur, and I added few more else if statements to the code the predict those scenarios, anyway,
I added those cars to the final scene, and I now should start working on the ending text, I actually want to make it
so that text moves from the top of the screen towards the bottom of the scene, you know, line in movies, after
that I should add music, and then I need to add some other sound effects I wanted to add, upload some images online
to use their links as alternative sources so that I can upload the game in SoloLearn, and everything should be done.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>324</h1>
<p>I made it so that the cars are positioned relatively to the screen's size and player's position, so that I
avoid overlapping for all different screen sizes, and I also finished with the ending scene, now there are some
sound effects I need to add and I'm almost done with this game.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>325</h1>
<p>I added many more sound effects to the game, for the button clicks, for when enemies are hit, for when they explode,
when the player is hit, and also changed some older sound effects. There were some problems I experienced so it took me a while
to make this work how I want it to, but at the end everything worked perfect. Then I started remaking some of the waves, changing the
dialogs a little and I basically tried ot make the game more entertaining.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>326</h1>
<p>I finished with the game dialogs and stuff, fixed the blood in the ending scene, so that that is has a transparency and
the road behind it is not hidden when too much blood is on screen. I also uploaded the images I use in the game in dropbox and
added the links as alternative sources to be used for the images.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>327</h1>
<p>Changed the dialogs, and enemies that are spawned in each wave, the purpose of
those changes was to make the game more entertaining, since it started to get boring
very quickly, I also added the game in SoloLearn, made some changes to the code that were needed
so that the size of the canvas is relative to the size of the screen, I also had to fix
a bug with the touchpads.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>328</h1>
<p>I fixed the max volumes of the sound effects, made it so that everything sounds
well, I also fixed some other bugs I found, there were few problems I had missed,
I think everything should be ready now, and I will probably upload the game tomorrow,
there is still one last bug I have to fix.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>329</h1>
<p>I fixed some grammar mistakes in dialogs, and also started working on the bug I mentioned the other day, so, basically,
sometimes sound effects will not play, because some browsers do not allow audio to start playing
without some kind of user interaction triggering it, because of this, sometimes errors are thrown.
Today, I only fixed the problem for the gameover and goodending songs, tomorrow I will have to
change the way sound effects are being played to fix this issue.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>330</h1>
<p>So, my plan for today was to make it so all sound effects start playing on a loop
when the user clicks to enter the game, with a volume of zero, and make it so when I want them
to play instead of using the play method I change their volume and currentTime, of course I also had
to use some clever coding tricks so that I make it turn volume back to 0 when the audio has been played, but also
take in account that an audio could be played multiple times, so I had to make sure that the setTimeout call
I made got canceled if another setTimout call to turn volume to 0 has been made. Anyway, at the end I managed to do this,
everything seems to be working well, some sound effects such as the click sound effect,
the swallow sound effect and the true ending song didn't need to be changed, since they will only play
when certain click events are triggered, so I left them as they were, I only need to play the game once now to
see that everything works well, and after I have finished testing the new code I will probably 
upload it, and if any user finds a bug they can just let me know so that I fix it later.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>331</h1>
<p>I started learning more about pixel data and how to better manipulate it,
and created a new section in my notes with a new cool project.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>332</h1>
<p>Due to some issues I could not program today</p>

<hr> 

<h1>333</h1>
<p>I am being writing a test in physics tomorrow, and the past week I have been studying a lot for it, today is the last day,
and I also had no laptop at home because my parents needed it, so I decided to dedicate the whole day at my studies, physics can be useful
in programming after all, so that's a lesson I find interesting and like to study, actually, it's not only because of programming,
I'm interested in better understanding how our world works in general, so physics, chimestry, biology and math are my favorite subjects.
I'm not very good at chimestry and biology though, especially now with corona virus I had not been paying attention in class at mornings so
I'm completely lost at those lessons.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>334</h1>
<p>I watched the rest one hour of the tutorial video I have been watching about pixel manipulation, and kinda learned
how to create a really cool effect which basically allows you to fill shapes with particles which move away from your mouse,
and it's a pretty cool effect. I say I kinda learned how because I still haven't coded this my self, I only watched the video
and finished with the basic structure of the code, it took me a while to make multi-touches support, so that I can make the effect
work not only for touch screens but also work with multi touches, and mouse movement as well of course. It's not like it took me much time,
I did have some difficulties but since I have worked with multi-touches in the past I already had a plan about how I wanted things to work,
I would had actually worked more on the project but I have started to work in my reasturant, and they needed me there at night,
now with school and work my schedual has really got kinda ruined, I have almost no free time, because in my free time I program, at morning I'm at school,
at night I'm at work, before work I do program a little but also have to do other stuff like feed my cats, shower, and other daily
stuff, and after work I usually am tired and want to sleep. When schools finish I will probably have more free time, for now I will
try to spend two or three hours programming per day, if possible more.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>335</h1>
<p>I worked more on the project I started yesterday, I made it so that particles are moved away from themouse, added physics to their movements,
made it work for both touches and mouse, hopefully this should also work for multi touches but I haven't checked. I also wrote a detailed
explanation of how the code works, what each calculation does and so it took me some time to do all that. Tomorrow I will probably finish the
project.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>336</h1>
<p>I continued the project and made it so that I can fill shapes with particles
and scale them up or move them, I then created a title using that effect and
added that to my home page.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>337</h1>
<p>My laptop had issues, I had to update windows and it took a lot of time, so 
I didn't do much today.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>337</h1>
<p>My laptop had issues, I had to update windows and it took a lot of time, so 
I didn't do much today.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>338</h1>
<p>Today I updated all pages I hadn't upadted in my page, created 
pages for my two new projects, the particle rain and the text effect and
linked them to the projects home page, I also fixed a problem in the diary document
and uploaded my new text effect project in SoloLearn.
</p>

<hr> 

<h1>339</h1>
<p>I fixed the text effect, there were issues with the multi touches and
also particles did not return to their original position some times, and the
reason was again the touches. Anyway, after a lot of debugging I think I fixed all issues,
I also made it so that the text is centered vertically, and updated the code in my notes too.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>340</h1>
<p>I fixed a problem with the font in the text project, sometimes the code could run before the font had loaded
and so the text wouldn't have a font. I also started studying computer science of my school, I do believe many of the
stuff they teach us are stupid, and that's not because they are completely useless but because I don't think
learning a fake educational programming language is needed, it would be much better if they taught us a real one.
However, I decided to start studying it at summer because next year I finish school and here in Greece after you finish
school there are those testS that we write to be accepted in third level educational schools, and so I will need to be prepared
since I will be writing math, computer science, greek language and economics. I need to be accepted into a school, because that
would probably help me learn more stuff about programming and computers and also that would give me more time before I have
to get a job and start living on my own.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>342</h1>
<p>I wrote about page's viewport and meta tags in a new notes section I created calle
"other front end notes", there I will basically write other front end stuff I want to write about
without having to care about where to write them and organize them, I basically built this because
I am tired of organizing everything, I need to get moving and learn faster, so worrying about such
things is a waste of time. I also had to edit the nav javascript file to add on the required code for
that new section and do some other file management.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>343</h1>
<p>I wrote about media queries today.

<h1>344</h1>
<p>I decided my flex notes which I had written months ago are very badly written
and so I decided to rewrite them in a more organizing way, this also will be a great way
to remember some stuff I have forgot. I start writing about flex box but didn't finish it.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>345</h1>
<p>I finished writing about all flexbox properties, tomorrow I may write about some more
tricks and stuff for flexbox and I also want to write about grid at some point.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>346</h1>
<p>I wrote about vendor prefixing of flexbox, and also, I talked about how and
when flexbox can be usefull, and I also created two really cool projects, a
navigation bar, and a simple responsive webpage layout that changes depending on screen
size using only few and clever lines of code, taking advantage of flexbox.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>347</h1>
<p>I started writing about CSS Grid layout again, this time I want to make a
good guide of how grid works with all the properties organized, not like
the guide I made months ago when I first learned about grid.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>348</h1>
<p>Doe to some issues I am having I was not feeling very well and
so I did not code today, I am trying to get better, so hopefully I
will be able to get more productive again.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>349</h1>
<p>I'm a little better, today I wrote about grid-template-areas,
I would had actually done more but like yesterday I didn't feel that well,
however, this is not the main reason I didn't do more, I would had actually finished
at least one more property in grid but I had problems with some stray kittens I'm taking
care of, one has a very bad eye infection so I am trying to find a way to get it
to the vet, I have some very bad social anxiety, so getting a bus to go to a vet by my self is gonna
be very challenging for me, I will try to get more info about when the vet is open,
and I will try to call him in the phone so that we can decide on a day, I will
also try to convince my brother to come with me and help me. Except from the eye infection,
I also had to rush outside today to get the kittens in when a sudden rain started,
it was very strong, and their nest isn't very well covered, they were so scared and wet
when I found them, I immediately picked them up and carried them inside
where I warmed them and brought their mother too. Because I'm
stupid, I took both the kittens and the mother inside and closed the door and windows, since
it was raining. The mother cat however wanted to poop, when I realized that it was already too late,
so I had to clean this up, it was disgusting. Anyway, because of all those problems, and some
other personal issues I am having, I didn't manage to code more today.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>350</h1>
<p>I didn't manage to program today because some stuff happened and I didn't have the time to program.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>351</h1>
<p>I wrote about some more properties of grid and studied
computer science for school, I learned about data structures
and other cool stuff.</p>

<hr>

<h1>352</h1>
<p>I finished all grid properties and studied trigoonometry
for school, I now understand better what rads are.</p>

<hr>

<h1>353</h1>
<p>I wrote about the difference between explicit and implicit grids and also
wrote about some other cool stuff like keywords or units that can be used
to better use grid.</p>

<hr>

<h1>354</h1>
<p>I made a project using grid, created a list of all the properties of grid that link to the
place I explain them so that by clicking on the property you automatically get pushed to the certain section.
I also fixed some other pages of my notes and did some other stuff.</p>

<hr>

<h1>355</h1>
<p>I read an article about Autoprefixer, and found out I am gonna need to use a task runner, such as Grunt for example,
and so I watched some tutorials about Grunt, but I stopped watching the tutorials after
I got to a point where the guy uses Grunt to convert SASS to CSS, because the YouTuber that
made those videos also has a really cool playlist about SASS, I decided it would
be cool to learn SASS first and then continue learning GRUNT. So,
I will learn more about SASS, then I will learn how to use Grunt task runner, and
then I will learn how to use autoprefixer. It is good that I am getting more and
more confortable using those tools, before I learn how to use NPM this all looked so
weird and hard to understand, editing files, using the command line, having tools
do things for you, but now I start to get mroe confortable with those stuff and this is good.
After I learn using SASS, Grunt and Autoprefixer I will finish the responsive web design course
I am taking in SoloLearn and start learning backend, that's the plan,
but I don't know how long this will take, I would be more productive but I am
also studying for school now days since I finish in a year and I need
to be prepared.</p>

<hr>

<h1>356</h1>
<p>I made an introduction to Sass and wrote how to install it and compile it to CSS.
I also created a section in my notes where I will put all the notes related to Sass,
those notes are nested inside the CSS notes, there are the normal CSS notes, the
extra CSS notes, and then the SASS notes, I also had to update the javascript file 
that makes the navigation bar at the start of each page so that Sass notes are added.</p>

<hr>

<h1>357</h1>
<p>I wrote about Sass variables and how to nest styles.</p>

<hr>

<h1>358</h1>
<p>I wrote about Sass mixins and how to import files.</p>
<hr>

<h1>359</h1>
<p>I wrote about how to nest pseudo classes in Sass, how to use mathematical operators,
and how to use colour functions.</p>
<hr>

<h1>358</h1>
<p>I couldn't code today, two kittens got stuck into a pipe outside
my house and couldn't get out, so I was digging all day to find where the pipe leads,
at the end I finally found them iside a cesspit, it was hard to open because it hadn't
been opened for years, I wouldn't even be able to tell it is there if I didn't hear
the kittens because it was covered in dirt, but after I dug the dirt off and hit it's edges with
a hoe for a while I finally managed to open it and got them off.</p>
<hr>

<h1>361</h1>
<p>I wrote more about Sass, I wrote about lists and spread operator and the @content keyword in mixins.</p>

<hr>

<h1>362</h1>
<p>I wrote more about Sass, I wrote about maps, interpolation, @for, @each and @while rules and also a little bit about @function
rule but didn't finish.</p>

<hr>

<h1>363</h1>
<p>I went on a trip today to Ithaka with a boat so I didn't have time to code.</p>

<hr>

<h1>364</h1>
<p>I wrote about what is grunt and how to install it.</p>

<hr>

<h1>365</h1>
<p>I wrote how to create tasks in Gruntfile.js, I also fixed a bug with NPM, for some reason
it wouldn't install grunt so I searched and found how to fix that. My keyboard also stopped working
so I had to use a screen keyboard, thankfully I used to play osu so I can type on a medium speed, it does
slow me down though but I gotta work with what I got.</p>
<hr>

<h1>366</h1>
<p>Today I didn't code, my parents took away the router and the laptop and I also had to study so coding today was kinda hard. I don't know what I will do without my laptop, I will not be able to continue learning about Grunt without it, but till I get it back I should find a way to continue my studies. I think since I have my phone I should continue doing the SoloLearn courses for now.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>367</h1>
<p>I finished the responsive web design course in SoloLearn and got my certificate. Now I am thinking about learning jQuary, I didn't really intend to learn it since manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript isn't that hard and jQuary isn't really used that much now days but since I have no laptop I could take a look in the course, why not. I am going to spend a lot of time learning it, it shouldn't really be that hard, I am just gonna speed run the course so that if I ever have to work on a project that uses it I can understand the code.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>368</h1>
<p>We had a black out because of a fire nearby and had no battery in my phone so I didn't code.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>369</h1>
<p>I learned more jQuary, how to get or set content, how to get or set attributes or input values, how to add content and some other stuff. 
</p>
<hr>

<h1>370</h1>
<p>I learned how to add, remove or toggle classes and manupulate the CSS of elements with jQuary, I also learned how to change height and width dimensions of elements.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>371</h1>
<p>I learned about traversing and removing elements with jQuary.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>372</h1>
<p>I learned about events in jQuary.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>373</h1>
<p>I created a to do list with jQuary and also learned about hide, show, toggle, fadeIn, fadeOut, fadeToggle, slideUp, slideDown and slideToggle jQuary effects, they are pretty cool, create amazing animation effects with just one line of code.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>374</h1>
<p>I learned how to make animations with jQuary and also how to very easily make a drop down list. I also finished the course so now I should decide what's next.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>375</h1>
<p>I started Angular + NestJS course. In this course I will learn how to create a full stack website with front end, back end and database. I will use Angular for front end and NestJS on back end. Today I learned some basic stuff about blackend, mostly theory. I learned what XML/HTTP Requests are, how HTTP responses are categorized and how the request circle works. It's bad that I don't have a laptop to keep notes of what I learn and code but I hope this doesn't prevent me from completing the course.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>376</h1>
<p>I was introduced to TypeScript and Angular. I learned how to define variable types, about enum values and how to create interfaces, how to add optional fields in those interfaces and some other basics about TypeScript. I also learned very little about Angular, I learned how to add it in your project but I didn't have a laptop to try this out, I also learned about Angular class and how to reference class variables or methods from Angular inside your html file.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>377</h1>
<p>Today I watched a 2 hours video about TypeScript and Angular and understood angular a lot more. I now understand what components are and what the files inside an Angular peoject are so it will be much easier for me to continue the course in SoloLearn. Here is the video I watched:  https://youtu.be/k5E2AVpwsko
</p>
<hr>

<h1>378</h1>
<p>I watched a video about how to make a typing effect with just CSS and how to make a cool 3d animation of a ball bouncing on a slime like cube with only CSS with realistic shadings. It didn't seem too hard, but there were some tricky parts I didn't completely get so when I get my laptop back I wanna go over it again step by step and recreate the project my self. I also learned about services in Angular and how to dependency injections work.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>379</h1>
<p>I learned about one way data binding and two ways data binding in Angular. I also learned how to update data inside a service from inside the component using methods which if used together with two way data binding can achieve very cool effects.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>380</h1>
<p>I was introduced to DataBases 
</p>
<hr>

<h1>381</h1>
<p>I learned how to write basic SQL and noSQL (mongodb) code
</p>
<hr>

<h1>382</h1>
<p>I learned about what an ORM (object relational mapping) is but decided to stop the course there because simple it is very badly written and I have not yet reached the blackend level required to complete it, I don't know shit about databases or how to host servers and all those stuff are just very frustrating to me, but it is not my fault, it's known SoloLearn sucks at teaching. For now I want to continue learning Grunt, then I want to learn git, and after this I was thinking about learning React, I was also thinking about studying data science to get started with backend at some point and also nodeJS. I will try to get my laptop back, so far without my laptop I did learn some cool stuff, I learned jQuary, typescript and the basics of Angular, but to go on from there I really need a laptop.
     </p>
    <hr>

<h1>383, 384, 385</h1>
<p>I started learning about databases, started watching an 8 hours video about database design.

<p>One of my cats died and I was very sad so I did nothing today and watched Netflix and play pokemon all day.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>388</h1>
<p>Another of my cats went missing, and the worst is that she has kittens, so now I have 4 kittens to worry about since I fear that the mother is not coming back, I looked for her, I'm afraid she may died. I was very busy with the kittens but did code today, I created a project for a friend's birthday, it was a canvas project so it was good remembering how the canvas works.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>389</h1>
<p>I found their mother but she has been poisoned and isn't well, today I was too busy to code.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>390</h1>
<p>The mother cat didn't make it and I was very sad, things have been bad lately so I need a break to start feeling better.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>391</h1>
<p>I continued the break. 
</p>
<hr>

<h1>392</h1>
<p>I watched another hour of the video about databases and learned much more about keys and some SQL commands that can define what happens to foreign keys when a parent key is updated or deleted. I also went back to the relationships part to remember a little how to design many to many relationships and it was easier to understand it now that I understand keys better. 
</p>
<hr>

<h1>393</h1>
<p>I learned how to draw a database design and some other stuff.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>394</h1>

<p>I learned how to install mySQL and some basic queries you can run</p>
<hr>

<h1>402</h1>
<p>I finally got my laptop back, I spent a lot of time 
preparing it, it lagged a lot so I reset it.
</p>
<hr>

<h1>403</h1>
<p>I set up everything I need for prograpping, downloaded VCS, NPM,
set up bash, downloaded my notes and started working. I continued writing about 
grunt and wrote how to use plygins, I also updated my diary which I had not updated 
for a month and it took me some time to add all those days and progress reports I 
had made. My keyboard does not work so it takes me time to type, I am 
using a screen keyboard, thanks to osu I can write one a avarage speed but it still 
slows me down a lot, I will try to find a solution soon.</p>

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) from scratch to make a calculator, I use a simulator in 
the computer to design those logical breaches. I also studied MySQL today, learned and 
wrote in my notes about how MySQL Workbench works.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>409</h1>
<p>I learned how a ram works and built a simple 8bit register, I also learned 
about USE, SELECT, FROM, WHERE and ORDER BY keywords in SQL.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>410</h1>
<p>I combined the 8bit register with my 8bit adder and 8bit substractor and 
with some clever logic I created an 8bit calculator that can add or substract 
binary numbers, it took me a while because this time I came up with 
the design on my own. I also learned about the AS and DISTINCT keywords in 
SQL and also how to perform mathematical operations on data.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>411</h1>
<p>I learned about IN, BETWEEN, LIKE and REGEXP SQL keywords.

<p>I learned how telephones work, I also spent a lot of time trying to 
fix a problem with CSS and floating elements,
CSS really is as annoying as I remember, after a long time of 
trying different stuff and searching online I managed to 
fix the bug. I also wrote some JavaScript which was cool since it had been 
a while since the last time I actually programmed something, I had no problems
with JavaScript, I love that language, CSS on the other hand 
sucks.</p>

<hr>

<h1>427</h1>

telnet and SSH.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>434</h1>
<p> I decided to refresh a little my jQuery knowledge by writing about it in my notes
since when I learned it earlier this summer I hadn't kept notes, I started writing about
jQuery in my notes and finished the overvies, wrote about how to install
jQuery and stuff like that, I also did some other organization things that
had to be done, such as creating the new links to my jQuery notes and also preparing
some CSS that I will be using to style my code examples so that they are easier to read.</p>

<hr>

<h1>435</h1>
<p>I wrote about how you can manipulate attributes and content with jQuery
</p>

<hr>

<h1>436</h1>
<p>I wrote about how to manipulate CSS with jQuery
</p>

</p>

<hr>

<h1>440</h1>
<p>Schools have now started and I also have to study for the other private lessons
I am having, so my days are a little busy now, it's my last year and I have decided
to study hard and maybe even get the highest grades in my class, I mean, I do am the best
at math and programming, so I don't see why couldn't I manage to do this, anyway,
I was busy studying and didn't program, because I also work, I will make sure
to find time to do everything, I also try to excercise and because of school I need
to sleep early so coding as much as I used to is not currently possible but
when I stop working I am going to have more time probably, but we will also start getting
homework from school soon so even then things will not be as easy as they used to.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>441</h1>
<p>Today I finished some stuff that had to be done in my notes, for example, I added links
for each section in my jQuery notes, and also in jQuery homepage so that I can easily
find and access those sections in the future, I also added links to mySQL notes, updated
this diary you are reading, and uploaded everything online, those stuff had to be done
and so I did them today since I just finished jQuery and didn't yet know what to learn next.
I also searched for new content to learn, I am thinking about studying more networking for now, 
and maybe I could also learn gulp, since I will have to at some point anyway, but I also want to
start learning backend as fast as possible, and so I was thinking about learning Python,
now Python isn't the best language for backend, but it is a good language to know in general and
since I want to learn more about ethical hacking too Python could come in handy in the future.
So what is the plan at the end? Well, gulp is a tool that both backend and frontend developers need to know,
so why not as well learn it now, I can also try learning some more networking every once in a while,
this is going to be something extra I will be doing when possible, after gulp I will probably
learn Python, as about ethical hacking I will learn more about it after
I have learned enough about networking.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>442</h1>
<p>Today I didn't manage to program sadly. I have been very busy lately, schools started,
I get less than 6 hours of sleep because of this, work takes a big part of my day, and I now need to sleep
early so coming at home late isn't the best thing. Also, I have a lot of homework for the private lessons
I am paying for, and that's not all, today I found one of my cats injured outside my house,
it seems she has broken or injured her pelvic, so she can't walk. Because of all those
problems I could not code, I didn't even have enough time to eat healthy and excercise,
I don't know what I will do, but for few days I doubt things will get any better. The
two next days I have a lot of homework and classes to attend, and I also have to secretly
keep my injured cat indoors till she gets better, I have to restrain her from moving around
for a while and make sure she eats well, my parents would kill me if they found out though,
they get really mad when the cats get inside. Anyway, next week is gonna be really tiring it seems,
but I will try getting back in track as soon as possible.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>443</h1>
<p>Couldn't code because of reasons mentioned before, it was a pretty shitty day today.</p>

<hr>

<h1>444</h1>
<p>Didn't code today either.</p>

<hr>

<h1>445</h1>
<p>Things are getting better, the week has finally passed and a new one begins,
so for a while I will not have to attend classes. My cat also gets better, she
can now move around without being in pain but she still needs time to recover.
I didn't manage to code today either, I decided to clean my room instead, I need the
place to be clean and organized, because I think being in a clean room will boost my productivity,
so from tomorrow I plan to start coding again.</p>

<hr>

<h1>446</h1>
<p>I finally made some progress, today I learned how to install and Initialize
git into a project. It was not too much, but at least I am getting back in track.
I want to try and start studying Networking again as well from tomorrow, if I can
learn both git and Networking daily that's gonna be great, but I have classes
at the end of the week and a lot of homework to finish, so I fear I may not
be able to do this. However, I am thinking of ways I can save time, perhaps
I could start doing my homework in school breaks or even in work whenever possible.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>447</h1>
<p>I learned how to check git status and add files to a staging environment.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>448</h1>
<p>I learned how to commit files with git, also, I learned how
to open help menu for git if I ever need help with a command.
Except from that however I also started watching a new course
about networking for ethical hacking, it teaches me networking but
I will be able to learn new things and also what I like the most
about this course is that I will be able to see network traffic how
it would really be displayed in a computer which is good to get confortable
with as an ethical hacker. We are also probably gonna use different kind of
hacking tools in the process and the course focuses on important networking concepts
specifically for hacking, so it's gonna be a cool course. Lastly,
I also took a loot at a back end course I found online in freeCodeCamp, it
looks pretty cool and I plan to go through it eventually after I finish learning
about Git.</p>

<hr>

<h1>449</h1>
<p>I was busy today, had to work and study, at night I came home around 10pm,
and I was planning to code a little, but I was so tired that I layed on my bed
a little and fell asleep. The good thing is that I hadn't slept so well for a
long time, I really needed this.
</p>

<hr>

<h1>450</h1>
<p>It's saturday today, and saturdays are very tiring for me, as I said before I
slept really good last night, I woke up at morning, and for the rest of the day I was
studying and working non stop. First I had three classes to attend, one after another,
economics, math and programming. Then I went to work, and after I came home I had a lot
of homework to do for the next day, I didn't even manage to finish everything so tomorrow
I will have to wake up early to finish.

<p>Today I managed to code a little, I learned about git branches. Another week has
finished and for the next few days things will be well, I will try to organize my
days better so that I do not have so much homework by the end of the week, because
right now I am not coding as much as I used to and I really need to get faster.
