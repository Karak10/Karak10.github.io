<h1> Introduction to JavaScript </h1>
</header>

<p><span>JavaScript</span> is one of the most popular <Span>programming languages</Span>
on earth and is used to <span>add interactivity</span> to webpages, <Span>process data</Span>, as well 
as <Span>create various applications</Span> (mobile apps, desktop apps, games, and more) </p>

<p>I'm very interested to learn this language better, since it's the first real programming language 
    I get to learn, <span>CSS</span> and <span>HTML</span> are not considered programming languages, 
    I'm also a little scared, it took me a while to learn <span>CSS</span> and <span>HTML</span>, 
    I can't even imagine how long it will take me to learn <span>JavaScript</span>, but the 
    only way to find out is to begin.
</p>

        <h1>Creating your first JavaScript</h1>

    </header>

<p>First, let's start with adding <Span>JavaScript</Span> to the <Span>webpage</Span>, 
we can do that by using the <Span>script</Span> element inside out <span>HTML</span>, 
you can use this element inside the <span>head section</span> or <span>body section</span>, 
it is recommended to use it at the <span>bottom of the body</span> so that 
the <span>webpage</span> loads completely before <Span>JavaScript</Span> is <span>rendered</span>. 
You can of course the <span>script</span> element multiple times, you don't have to use 
it only once, also, just like when adding <span>CSS</span> you can also write 
<span>external JavaScript code</span> in a different <span>document</span> and link 
it to this <Span>document</Span> by writing <span>&lt;script src="example.js'> &lt;/script></span>.</p>

<p>IT'S TIME NOW! To take the FIRST step to SUCEES! The FIRST step to becoming the 
    GREATEST WEB DEVELOPER of all! Let's write our first JAVASCRIPT code!
</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>

    document.write("Hello World!");

&lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>


<Script>

document.write("Hello World!");

</Script>

<p>The <span>document.write()</span> function writes <Span>string</Span> into 
our <span>HTML</span> document. This function can be used to write <span>text</span>, 
<Span>HTML</Span> or both.</p>

<p>Let's try using <Span>HTML tags</Span> to format <span>text</span> in <span>JavaScript</span>.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>
    
    document.write("&lt;h3 style='text-align: left;'> Hello World! &lt;/h3>");

&lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

document.write("<h3 style='text-align: left;'> Hello World! </h3>");

        <h1>JavaScript Comments</h1>

    </header>

<p>To add a <span>comment</span> inside your <span>JavaScript</span> you 
can either write what you want <span>after double slash //</span>, or <Span>between /* and */</Span>.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>

    //this is a single line comment

/* This is 
a multy
line comment */

alert("Welcome my friends to the first page of my JavaScript notes!");

&lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

//this is a single line comment

/* This is 
a multy
line comment */

//alert("Welcome my friends to the first page of my JavaScript notes!");

</script>

<p>Using comments is good, use them a lot to keep your code organized, 
    your future self will thank you a lot, since it will make things way 
    easier if you ever need to go over the code again to fix stuff, it's 
    also required to used comments when working with other people on a big project, 
    reading code written by someone else can be one of the hardest things, really, 
    your co-workers will be very thankful if you wrote a description of what your 
    code does.

        <h1>JavaScript Variables</h1>

    </header>


<p><span>Variables</span> are <span>containers</span> for storing <span>data values</span>. 
The <Span>value</Span> of a <Span>variable</Span> can <span>change</span> through the 
<Span>program</Span>. To declare a <span>variable</span> you can use the <span>var</span>
keyword:</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>

    var x = "Hello, I'm a variable!";
    document.write(x);
    
    &lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

var x = "Hello, I'm a variable!";
document.write(x);

</script>

<p><span>JavaScript</span> is <Span>case sensitive</Span>, if for example 
the <Span>x</Span> was <Span>capitalized</Span> and I wrote <span>document.write(x)</span>
it wouldn't work.</p>

<p>In <span>JavaScript</span> the <Span>equal sign</Span> (=) is called the <Span>"assignment"</Span>
operator, rather than an "equal to" operator. For example, <Span>x = y</Span> will asign 
the value of <span>y</span> to <span>y</span>.</p>

<p>Using <span>variables</span> is useful in many ways, you might have a thousand lines 
of code that may include the <span>variable</span> x, when you change the value of x <Span>one time</Span>,
it will automatically be changed in <Span>all places</Span> where you used it.</p>

<p style="line-height: 23px;">Naming rules: <br> 
-The first character <Span>must be</Span> a <Span>letter</Span>, an <Span>underscore</Span>
(_), or a <Span>dollar sign</Span> ($). <Span>Subquent characters</Span> may be 
<Span>letters</Span>, <span>digits</span>, <span>underscores</span>, or <span>dollar signs</span>.<br>
-<span>Numbers</span> are <Span>not allowed</Span> as the <span>first character</span>. <br>
-<span>Variable</span> names <span>cannot</span> include <Span>mathematical or logical operators</Span>
in the <Span>name</Span>. For instance, <Span>2*something</Span> or <span>this+that</span>. <br>
-<span>JavaScript</span> names <Span>must not contain spaces</Span>.</p>

<p>There are some other <span>rules</span> to follow when namking your <span>JavaScript variables</span>:</p>

<p>-You <span>must not</span> use any <Span>special symbols</Span>, like <Span>#num</Span>, 
<span>num%</span>, etc. <br>
-Be sure that you <span>do not</span> use any of the following <span>JavaScript reversed words</span>:</p>

<style>

.somethingbruh {
    display: block; 
    margin: auto;
}

</style>

<img class="somethingbruh" src="../images/reversedwords.png">

<p>When you get more familiar with <span>JavaScript</span>, remembering these <span>keywords</span>
will be much easier.</p>

        <h1>Data Types</h1>

    </header>

<p>The term <span>data type</span> refers to the <span>types</span> of 
<span>values</span> with which a <Span>program</Span> can work. <span>JavaScript variables</span>
can hold many <span>data types</span>, such as <span>numbers</span>, <span>strings</span>,
<span>arrays</span>, and more.</p>

<p>Unlike many other <Span>programming languages</Span>, <span>JavaScript</span> does 
not define <Span>different types of numbers</Span>, like <span>integers</span>, <span>short</span>, 
<Span>long</Span>, <Span>floating-point</Span>, etc.</p>

<p><Span>JavaScript numbers</Span> can be written with or without <span>demicals</span>.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>

    var x = 69 /* A number without decimals */, y = 10.5 /* A number with decimals */; 
document.write('"', x, '"', " is a better number than ", '"', y, '"', " and that's a fact! ");
    
    &lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

var x = 69 /* A number without decimals */, y = 10.5 /* A number with decimals */; 
document.write('"', x, '"', " is a better number than ", '"', y, '"', " and that's a fact! ");

</script>

<p><span>JavaScript strings</span> are used for <Span>storing</Span> and 
<span>manipulating</span> text. A <span>string</span> can be any 
<spaN>text</spaN> that appears within <span>quotes</span>, you can use <span>single</span>
or <Span>double</Span> quotes, if you use <Span>double quotes</Span> then you can 
use <span>single quotes</span> inside the <span>string</span> without a problem, the 
opposite is also true, if you use <span>single quotes</span> then you are able to use 
<Span>double quotes</Span> inside the <Span>string</Span> without any problem.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>
   
var x = "My name is 'Karak10' and I'm cool.", y='My name is "Karak10" and Im cool.';
document.write(x, "&lt;br>");
document.write(y);
    
    &lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

var x = "My name is 'Karak10' and I'm cool.", y='My name is "Karak10" and Im cool.';
document.write(x, "<br>");
document.write(y);

</script>

<p>What if you want to use <Span>same</Span> quotes that you used to <Span>surround the string</Span> inside 
the <Span>string</Span>? In the code above for example, I wanted to put a <Span>single quote</Span> at <Span>I'm</Span>
in <Span>variable y</Span> but I couldn't because the <span>string</span> was surrounded by <Span>single quotes</Span>, 
there is a way to do that, by simply using <span>backslash</span>, like this: <span>\'</span>, or <Span>\"</Span>, 
you can also use the <span>backslash</span> to insert other <Span>special characters</Span>
into a <Span>string</Span>.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript code:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>
   
    var x = 'My name is "Karak10" and I\'m cool.';
    document.write(x);
    
    &lt;/script></span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

var x = 'My name is "Karak10" and I\'m cool.';
document.write(x);

</script>

<p>These <spaN>special characters</spaN> can be added using <span>backslash</span>:</p>

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="../images/specialcharacters.png">

<P>In <span>JavaScript Boolean</span>, you can have <Span>one</Span> or <Span>two</Span> values, 
either <Span>true</Span> or <span>false</span>. These are useful when you need a <span>data type</span>
that can only have <Span>one</Span> or <span>two</span> values, such as <Span>Ye/No</Span>, 
<span>On/Off</span>, <Span>True/False</Span>. </P>

<p class="left">Example:</p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">&lt;script>
   
    var isActive = true;
var isInactive = false;
    
    &lt;/script></span></p>

var isActive = true;

        <h1>Math Operators</h1>

    </header>

<p><Span>Arithmetic operators</Span> perform <span>arithmetic functions</span>
on <Span>numbers</Span> (literals or variables).</p>

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="../images/idkdude.png">

<p>In the example below the <Span>addition operator</Span> is used 
to determine the <span>sum of two numbers</span>.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript Code: </p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">var x = 5 + 5, y = 5 + 5;
    document.write(x + y);</span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>
   
<Script>

var x = 5 + 5, y = 5 + 5;
document.write(x + y);

</Script>

<p>Let's now use <Span>substraction</Span>, <Span>multiplication</Span>
and <span>division</span> operators to play around a little, I don't think 
I need to explain basic <span>math operators</span> like these.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript Code: </p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">var x = 10 / 2, y = 2.5 * 2, b = 10 - 5;
    document.write(x + y + b)</span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<script>

var x = 10 / 2, y = 2.5 * 2, b = 10 - 5;
document.write(x + y + b)

</script>

<p>Now, about <span>modulus operator</span>, I have seen this one in the past so I know 
how it works, it basically works like <Span>division operator</Span>, however, 
if I did <Span>10 / 3</Span> for example, <Span>3</Span> can fit <span>three times</Span>
inside <span>10</span> when it gets to <Span>9</Span>, if we added <Span>3</Span> one more time 
for example it would surpass <Span>10</Span> and went to <span>12</span>, we now get 
<Span>9</Span>, and do <Span>10 - 9</Span> which equals <span>1</span>, that's the number 
we would get if we did <Span>10 % 3</Span>, it lets us know how much numbers away 
from <Span>10</Span> it gets, if that makes any sense, I'm not really the best at 
explaining stuff, especially in english since that's not my native language, 
if we did <span> 10 % 5</span> we would get <Span>0</Span>, since <span>5</span> can fit 
perfectly inside <Span>10</Span>, if we did <Span>8 % 3</Span> we would get <Span>2</Span>, 
since after <Span>3</Span> gets to <span>6</span> if we added anoter <span>3</span> it 
would surpass <Span>8</Span> and go to <Span>9</Span>, if we do <Span>8 - 6</Span>
we get <Span>2</Span>, I hope you understand.</p>

<p class="left">JavaScript Code: </p>

<p class="left"><span class="code10">
    var x = 10 % 3, y = 10 % 5, b = 8 % 3;
    document.write("10 % 3 = ", x, 
    " &lt;br> 10 % 5 = ", y, 
    " &lt;br> 8 % 3 = ", b);</span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

var x = 10 % 3, y = 10 % 5, b = 8 % 3;
document.write("10 % 3 = ", x, 
" <br> 10 % 5 = ", y, 
" <br> 8 % 3 = ", b);

 

</script>

<p>About the <span>Increment</span> and <Span>Decrement</Span> operators now, if placed <Span>before</Span> the <Span>operand</Span>, 
for example, if we wrote <Span>var b = 10, a = ++b;</Span>, then, <span>a</span> would get the 
value of <span>b</span> and would get <span>increased by one</span>, and <Span>b</Span> would also get 
<span>increased by one</span>, if we wrote <span>b++</span> then <span>a</span> would 
get the value of <Span>b</Span> without being increased by one, and <Span>b</Span>
would only be <Span>increased by one</Span>. </p>

<p>The same goes for <Span>--b</Span> and <Span>b--</Span>, if placed <Span>after</span>, then 
<span>a</span> would get the <Span>value of b</Span>, and <Span>b</Span> would be 
<Span>decreased</Span> this time by one, if placed <Span>before</Span> then 
<span>a</span> would get the <Span>value of b</Span> and would be <Span>decreased by one</Span>, 
and <span>b</span> also would be <Span>decreased by one</Span>, making them have the 
same value.</p>

if I wrote <Span>var x = '10';</Span> for example, which 
is a <span>string</span> when I wrote <Span>x == 10</Span>
it would come up as true, even tho <Span>10</Span> is a number,
that's where we use <span>===</span> which checks 
if it's <Span>equal</Span> and of <Span>same type</Span>, I 
hope you understand.</p>

<p><span>Logical operators</span>, also known as <Span>Boolean Operators</Span>, 
evaluate the expression and return <Span>true</span> or <Span>flase</span>.</p>

<img style="display: block; margin: auto;" src="https://api.sololearn.com/DownloadFile?id=2749">

<p>For example:<br> <br>
<Span>6&lt;5 && 7&lt;8</Span> will return <Span>false</Span> because first operator is not true<br>
<span>6&lt;5 || 7&lt;8</Span> will return <Span>true</Span> because second operator is true<br>
<Span>!(6&lt;5)</Span> will return <Span>true</Span> because the operator is false</p>

<p>You can also remember it like this: <br><br>
<Span>AND</Span> - <Span>&&</Span><br>
<span>OR</span> - <span>||</span><br>
<span>NOT</span> - <span>!</span></p>

<p class="left">JavaScript Code:</p>

<p class="left"><Span class="code10">&lt;script>

    var x = 10, y = 15;
    
    (x &lt; 15 && y == 16) ? document.write("True &lt;br>"): document.write("False &lt;br>"); 
    (x &lt; 15 || y == 16)? document.write("True &lt;br>"): document.write("False &lt;br>");
    (!(x > 15))? document.write("True &lt;br>"): document.write("False &lt;br>");
    
    &lt;/script></Span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>


<script>

var x = 10, y = 15;

(x < 15 && y == 16) ? document.write("True <br>"): document.write("False <br>"); 
(x < 15 || y == 16)? document.write("True <br>"): document.write("False <br>");
(!(x > 15))? document.write("True <br>"): document.write("False <br>");
