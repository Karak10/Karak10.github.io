        <h1>Terminal Commands</h1>
    </header>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>When you are using the <Span>command line</Span> in any computer, and you are writing 
<Span>commands</Span> and <span>text appears on your screen</span>, that's what we call a 
<Span>terminal application</Span>. This <Span>terminal application</Span> is <Span>sending your commands</Span> to 
a <Span>Shell</Span>, and the <Span>Shell</Span> is responsible for <Span>understanding your commands</Span> and 
<Span>executing the commands</Span> you request.</p>

<p>On <Span>Linux and Mac</Span>, one of the most popular <Span>shells</Span> available is <span>Bash</span>, which allows you to 
<Span>type in commands</Span>, and <Span>executes those commands</Span>, and then <Span>see those results on screen</Span>, and it also allows 
you to <Span>take information from one application</Span> and <Span>pipe it or pass it into the next application</Span>, then <Span>pipe it into the next application</Span> and so on. 
That <Span>information</Span> is passed as <Span>text</Span> and allows you to get the 
<Span>output of one application</Span> and <Span>pipe it into the next</Span>.</p>

<p>In <Span>Windows</Span>, we have the <Span>Cmds shell</Span>, which can also 
<Span>execute commands</Span>, it can also <span>pass information from one command to the next</span>
and that <Span>information</span> is <Span>passed as text</Span>, however, <Span>Cmd</Span> is 
<Span>relatively limited</Span> in today's world, so we were introduced a <Span>new technology</Span> back 
in around <Span>2005</Span> called <Span>PowerShell</Span>.</p>

<p><Span>PowerShell</Span> is a whole new approach to
<Span>command-line shell technology</Span>. It essentially still 
provides you a <Span>command-line syntax</Span>, and 
<Span>scripting syntax</Span> that you can 
<Span>type commands into</Span> but it <Span>takes the information</Span>
that you can <Span>pass from one application to the next</Span>, and 
<Span>passes it as rich objects</Span> that you can <Span>query</Span> 
and <Span>manipulate</Span> far more easily than you can process <span>text</span>. 
<Span>PowerShell</Span> is now available on <Span>Mac</Span> and <Span>Linux</Span> 
as well, and it's becoming very <Span>broadly adopted</Span>.</p>

<h2>How and why to use Bash on windows10:</h2>

<p><span>Bash</span> is much more <Span>applicable</Span> when it comes to 
<Span>web development</Span>, being the <Span>default command line</Span> for 
many <Span>Linux/*nix systems</Span>.</p>

<p>In order to use <Span>bash</Span> in <span>Windows 10</span> you will have to use 
<Span>Windows Subsystem for Linux</Span> (WSL), which you can do from 
<Span>setting</Span> and then you have to <Span>download Ubuntu</Span> to use as 
<Span>distribution</Span> for <Span>WSL</Span>, more information about how to do this 
can be found in the following video:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ap3hL-UR9I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>After you are done, open your <Span>terminal</Span> in <Span>VSC</Span> and 
type <Span>bash</Span>, after you do that you should be able to run <span>bash commands</span>
without a problem:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal6.png">

<h2><u>Introduction to Bash Terminal commands</u></h2>


You are gonna be using <Span>terminal</Span> for a lot of tasks in your development life, such as, 
<Span>updating your projects in git</Span>, <Span>create files</Span>, <Span>move files</Span>, 
and in general <Span>manipulate files</Span>, the <Span>terminal</Span> is also used to 
<Span>download JavaScript packages</Span> and many other things.</p>

<p>So, the <Span>first command</Span> we are gonna see is <Span>pwd</Span>, which stands for 
<Span>Present Working Directory</Span> and it returns the <Span>directory you are currently in</Span>, for 
example, in <Span>VSC's terminal</Span>, when you <Span>open a new terminal window</Span> you will by default be 
inside the <Span>folder you had opened in VSC</Span>, let's try this:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal1.png">

<p>As you can see, the <span>path</span> of my <Span>folder</Span> is returned, 
if I wanted to <Span>go up one level</Span>, so, in other words, if I wanted to <span>leave the file</span>
and <span>enter the Dekstop</span> I could write <Span>cd ..</Span> command, every time you write 
<Span>cd ..</Span> you enter the <Span>previous directory of the one you are currently in</Span>, here is an example:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal2.png">

<p>To <Span>enter a file</Span> you can use <span>cd path\</span>, if you write 
the <Span>path of the file</Span> followed by a <span>backslash</span> "\" then 
it should work, let's try this:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal3.png">

<p>If the <span>terminal</span> is starting to get too full of <Span>commands</Span>, 
then you can use the <span>clear</span> command to <Span>clear the terminal</Span>. If you 
want to <Span>reuse a command</Span>, you can use the <Span>up and down arrow keys</Span> which will reference 
to the <Span>commands history</Span>, the <Span>up arrow</Span> will <Span>return the previous commands</Span>, and if you go too back and 
pass the wanted <Span>command</Span> you can use the <Span>down arrow</Span> to <Span>reverse</Span>, think of it as a <span>list of commands that were recently used</span>, 
every time you press the <Span>up arrow key</Span> you go <Span>down the list</Span>, towards the <span>older used commands</span>, 
every time you press the <Span>down arrow</Span> you go <Span>up the list</Span> towards the <Span>newer used commands</Span>.
Another useful tip to save time is to use the <span>tab key</span> which will <Span>fill in the command</Span> for you, 
if for example I wanted to access my <Span>for-terminal-testing</Span> file and I was inside <Span>Desktop</Span>
I could write <Span>cd for-</Span> and then press <Span>tab</Span>, and if the <Span>for-terminal-testing file was the only file that starts with for-</Span> then
the name would be filled automatically.
</p>

<p>The <Span>mkdir</Span> command stands for <Span>Make Directory</Span> and 
it can be used to <Span>create files</Span>, if for example I wanted to 
create a <span>folder called Steve</span> I could write <Span>mdkir Steve</Span>,
let's try this out:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal4.png">

<p>The <span>ls</span> command <Span>returns a list</Span> of all the <Span>files inside the folder</Span>, 
here is an example:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal5.png">

<p>If you wanted to create a <Span>file</Span>, such as an <Span>html file</Span> for example, 
or <Span>any kind of file</Span> in general, you could use the <Span>touch</Span> command, followed by the 
<Span>name of the file</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal7.png">

<p>The <span>ls -l</span> command also returns a <Span>list of the files</Span> inside 
the <Span>present working directory</Span> however, the <Span>list</Span> contains 
a little <Span>more information</Span> about the <span>files</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal8.png">

<p>As you can see, the <Span>directories</Span> (folders) begin with <Span>dr</Span> while 
the <Span>files</Span> begin with <Span>-r</Span>.</p>

<p><span>Files</span> which their <Span>names</Span> start with a <Span>dot</Span> are 
called <Span>hidden files</Span> and will <span>not be visible</span> 
in the <Span>lists</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal9.png">

<p>If you want to see the <Span>hidden files</Span>, you can write <Span>ls -a</Span>, 
which will show <Span>all the files</Span>, or, if you want to <Span>see all the files</Span>
with <Span>more details about each file</Span> you can use <Span>ls -la</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal10.png">

<p>As you have probably noticed, there are also <Span>two directories</Span> I 
dididn't add in my <Span>directory</Span>, one is <Span>..</Span>, the other is <Span>.</Span>, 
as I said before, <Span>cd ..</Span> takes you to the <span>previous directory</span> of the <Span>path</Span>, so this 
<span>.. directory</span> is the <span>parent directory</span>, while <Span>.</Span> is 
the <Span>current directory</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal11.png">

<p>If you want to <Span>remove a directory</Span> (folder) you can use the 
<span>rmdir</span> which stands for <Span>Remove Directory</Span>, like this:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal12.png">

<p>To <Span>remove a file</Span> you can use the <span>rm</span> command, followed by 
the <Span>name of the file</Span> you want to <Span>remove</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal13.png">

<p>When you try to <Span>remove a directory</Span> that <Span>is not empty</Span>, an 
<Span>error message</Span> will show up:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal14.png">

<p>To <Span>force a directory to be removed</Span> even if it 
<Span>is not empty</Span> you can use <Span>rm -rf</Span> command, which 
will <span>remove the directory and everything inside it</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal15.png">

<p>The <Span>mv</Span> command stands for <span>move</span>, it can be used to 
<Span>move files</Span> but also can be used to <Span>rename files</Span>, if you 
want to <Span>rename a file</Span> you can do this like this: <Span>mv example.html newname.html</Span>,  
if you want to <Span>move a file</Span> you can write: <Span>mv example.html path/</Span>. To 
<Span>move and rename a file</Span> you can do something like this: <Span>mv file.html path/newname.html</Span> and 
lastly if you want to 
<span>move multiple files</span> then you can write <span>mv file1.html file2.html /path</span>, here is an example:</p>

<img src="../images/terminal16.png">

<p>The next <span>command</span> we are gonna learn is the <Span>cp</Span> command which stands for 
<span>copy</span>, it lets you <Span>compy a file or folder</Span>, the <Span>syntax</Span> looks like this: 
<Span>cp file.html path/copiedfile.html</Span>. If you want to <span>copy</span> the <span>file</span> at
<Span>the same directory</Span> then you don't need to add a <Span>path</Span>, you can just write the <Span>name of the copied file</Span> like this: 
<Span>cp file.html copiedfile.html</Span></p>

        <h1>How to install VSC live server extension</h1>
    </header>

    <p>To <Span>install extensions</Span> to <Span>Visual Studio Code</Span> you can very easily access the your 
    <Span>extensions</Span> or <Span>find and install new extensions</Span> by entering the <Span>extensions section</Span>
which can be easily accessed by <Span>clicking here</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/extensions1.png">

<p>If for whatever reason, <Span>you are not viewing this bar at the left</Span> you can also 
<Span>access the extensions section</Span> another way, to do that, <Span>hold ctrl and shift and then press p</Span>, 
this will open a <Span>search bar</Span>, there, <Span>type "install extensions"</Span> and click on <span>Install Extensions</span>,
this will open the <span>extensions manager</span>.</p>

<p>After you do that search for <Span>Live Server</Span>, and click on it:</p>

<img src="../images/extensions2.png">

<p>As expected, the next step is to <Span>begin the installation</Span>.</p>

<p>After the <Span>installation is finished</span>
you are all set to start using it, there are <Span>a few different ways</Span>
to use it, and you can actually read the <Span>instructions</Span>
in the <span>details of the extension</span>, but the easiest way to use it in my 
opinion is to simple <Span>right click on the html file you wanna use</Span> and 
<Span>click open with live server</Span>. After you have done it the 
<span>server</span> will <Span>update</span> every time you 
<span>save the file</span>.</p>

        <h1>Node Package Manager:</h1>
    </header>

    <h2><u>What is NPM:</u></h2>
    
    <p><span>NPM</span> stands for <span>Node Package Manager</span> that is installed with 
    <Span>Node.js</Span>, without that necessarily meaning you need to know <span>Node.js</span> to use 
    it.</p>

    <p><span>NPM</span> is, as the name says, used to <span>manage packages</span>, what are <Span>packages</Span>? 
    They are usually referred to as <Span>modules</Span>, or <Span>JavaScript libraries</Span>, and they are 
    basically <span>JavaScript code</span> that <Span>somebody else made</Span> and <Span>shared with us</Span>, 
    which can be used to <Span>simplify</Span> and <Span>speed up the process</Span> of specific <Span>tasks</Span>. For example, 
    there is a <Span>package</Span> called <Span>moment</Span> which allows you to easily <Span>manipulate dates</Span> 
    and stuff, with this <Span>package</Span> you can for example <Span>create a date object</Span> and with 
<span>one method of the package</span> you could <Span>display the date in a wanted format</Span> without having to hand write the code for it.</p>

<h2><u>How to install NPM:</u></h2>

<p>To <Span>install NPM</Span> you should simple go to <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">this site</a> 
and <Span>download Node.js</span>, as I said before, <Span>NPM</Span> will be <Span>downloaded with Node.js</Span>,
so after you are done downloading, <Span>NPM</Span> should have been downloaded too, and if you search for it you 
should find it in the <span>nodejs folder</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm1.png">

<h2><u>About package.json and how to edit default answers:</u></h2>

<p>To <Span>install packages</Span> in your 
<Span>project</Span> you are gonna need a <span>package.json</span> file first, but what is 
it used for? And why is it so important?</p>

<P>The <Span>package.json file</Span> contains 
<Span>information about your projects</Span>, such as 
<span>name</span>, <span>description</span> and others, but what's more important is that it <Span>lists all the dependencies (name & version)</Span> 
of your <Span>project</Span>, what are <span>dependencies</span> you may 
wonder now, so let me explain. <Span>Dependencies</Span> are the 
<Span>packages</Span> you are using, basically, 
you are <Span>depending on those packages</Span>, since 
if those <Span>packages</Span> were to be <span>removed</span> then 
<Span>problems would be created to your project</Span> (since it's using
those packages). The <Span>versions</Span> of those 
<Span>packages</Span> are also included in the <span>package.json file</span>
as well as <Span>instructions about how the versions should be updated</Span>, since <Span>versions</Span>
could also create problems to your <Span>Project</Span> if they are changed. Lastly, 
<Span>NPM scripts</Span> can be added in the <span>package.json file</span> but I will talk more about 
those stuff later.</P>

<p>When using <Span>one package</Span> by the way, you may only <Span>depend on that package</Span>, but 
<Span>that package</Span> may <Span>depend on other packages</Span> that may <span>also depend on other packages</span>, 
and that <Span>dependency chain</Span> goes deeper and deeper.</p>

<p>Knowing all that is useful, because by only having this <Span>package.json</Span> file 
in your possesion later allows you to <Span>download all packages to the specific versions the project needs them</Span> 
all with <Span>one command</Span>. For example, I could <Span>share my files</Span> with 
<span>another person</span>, but <Span>not send him the modules of the packages</Span>, and 
<Span>only send him my files and the package.json file</Span>, with only that, he could then 
with <span>one command</span> get <Span>everything downloaded</Span> by him self. Before we learn about that 
however, let's first learn how to create a <Span>package.json file</Span> in the first place.</p>

<p>You could <Span>hand write the file</Span>, however, that would be stupid, since you can 
very easily <Span>automatically do this</Span> using the <Span>npm  init</Span> command:</p>

<p>First I'm gonna <Span>change shell in my terminal</Span> to <Span>cmd</Span>, 
and that's only because for some reason I am facing some problems while trying to 
access <Span>npm commands with bash or PowerShell</Span>, I will find a solution and write 
about it later, for now we are gonna use <span>cmd</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm2.png">

<p>Now, let's use the <Span>npm init</Span> command:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm3.png">

<p>So, when I wrote <Span>npm init</Span> I were asked few <Span>questions</Span> which 
I had to <Span>answer</Span>, some of those <Span>questions</Span> already had 
a <Span>default answer</Span> that I could leave be by <Span>pressing enter</Span>, those 
<Span>default answers</Span> were <Span>between ()</Span>, I could also use 
<Span>enter</Span> to <Span>skip questions</Span>.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can use <span>npm init --yes</span> or <Span>npm init -y</Span> 
to <Span>skip the questioning</Span> and <Span>immediately make the package.json file</Span> 
using the <Span>default answers</Span>, so let's <Span>remove package.json</Span> and 
try to <Span>initialize it again</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm4.png">

<p>If you want to <Span>edit the default options</Span> you can use 
<Span>npm config set init-{the option} 'value'</Span>, you could also do this 
<span>without the config</span> and as long as it had the keyword <Span>set</Span> it would still work. 
To <Span>check the default value</Span> of an <Span>init option</Span> you can use <Span>npm config get init-{the option}</Span> or 
just <span>npm get init-{the option}</span> without the <Span>config</Span>, here are some examples:</p>


<img src="../images/for-npm5.png">

<p>Let's now check if they are, in need, the <Span>default answers</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm6.png">

<p>Alright, so now, let's take a quick look into the <Span>package.json</Span> file 
it self, just so we see what it looks like:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm7.png">

<h2><u>How to install and use packages:</u></h2>

<p>To <Span>install packages</Span> I recommend checking out <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">this site</a> where you 
can find <Span>packages</Span>, which usually include the <Span>install command</Span> you have to use to 
<Span>install them</Span> which you can <span>copy paste</span>, and they usually also contain 
<Span>guides</Span> and <Span>instructions</Span> of how the <span>package</span> works and stuff.</p>

<p>To <span>install a package</span> you should use the <span>npm install</span> command, 
in the past, writing <Span>npm install package</Span> would <Span>only install the modules without updating the package.json file</Span>, 
and to <Span>do both</Span> you had to use the <span>--save flag</span> like this: <Span>npm install package --save</Span>, however, 
today it will <Span>update package.json</Span> even if you don't add that flag:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm8.png">

<p>Alright, so, <span>node_modules folder</span> was added, which contains the 
<Span>modules of the package</Span>, and a <Span>file called package-lock.json</Span> was 
also created, this <Span>file</Span> is <Span>automatically generated</Span> for any 
<Span>operations</Span> where <Span>npm modifies</Span> either the <Span>node_modules tree</Span>, 
or <Span>package.json</Span>. It <Span>describes the exact tree</Span> that was <Span>generated</Span>, 
such that <span>subsequent installs</span> are able to <Span>generate indentical trees</Span>, 
regardless of <span>intermediate dependency updates</span>.</p>

<p>The <Span>package.json</Span> file was also <Span>updated</Span>, since now it has 
<Span>one dependency</Span>, let's take a look in both two files now:</p>

<p>Here is the <Span>package-lock.json</Span> file:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm10.png">

<p>And here is the <Span>package.json</Span> file:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm9.png">

<p>Let's now <Span>install another package</Span> called 
<span>moment</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm11.png">

<p>This will <Span>update</Span> both files, but I'm not gonna show that to you, the reason 
I added this <Span>package</Span> is so that I try using it in my <Span>code</Span>, first,
let's <Span>create a javascript file</Span> and <span>write the code</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm12.png">

<p>I used <Span>require()</Span> method to <span>add the package</span>, if I was 
writing the code to be ran by a <Span>web browser</Span> I would had used 
<Span>ES6 import keyword</Span>, but now, I'm just gonna run it with <Span>Node.js</Span>
by writing <Span>node index.js</Span> in my <Span>terminal</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm13.png">

<p>So, this <Span>package</Span> basically helped me create a <Span>beautiful date format</Span> which 
I normally would have to write <span>few lines of code</span> to make, with <Span>just one method</Span>, 
and it actually has many kind of different <span>formats</span> you can use, and it just saves you a lot of time, 
since without it you would have to <Span>hand write</Span> everything from scratch.</p>

<p>If I wanted to <Span>share this application</Span> I just created, under other circumstances, I could be 
using <Span>twenty different packages</Span> for example, if it was a big project, and <span>sharing all my files with all those packages</span>
would be hard, because <Span>twenty packages</Span> are a lot of content, the good thing is, as I had mentioned before, 
you don't need to share the <Span>modules</Span>, as long as you have the <span>package.json</span> file in your possesion 
you should be able to just type <Span>npm install</Span> in your <Span>terminal</Span>, and it will 
<span>install everything for you</span>, let's <Span>remove package-lock.json file and node_modules folder</Span> now 
and use <Span>npm install</Span> to see if it works:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm14.png">

<h2><u>Dependencies/dev-dependencies and how to uninstall Packages:</u></h2>

<p>Alright, so, to <Span>install the packages</Span> needed for the 
<Span>application to run</Span> it looks at the <Span>dependencies</Span> of the 
<Span>package.json file</Span>, since the <Span>application depends on those packages</Span>, but 
what are those <Span>other dependencies</Span> called <Span>dev-dependencies</Span>?</p>

<p>You are gonna <Span>install something</Span> as a <Span>dev-dependency</Span> if 
it's <Span>only gonna be used for development</Span> without your <Span>application</Span> being 
<Span>depending on it</Span>. One example I can think of is something like 
<Span>gulp</Span> which is a <Span>task runner</Span>, so let's <Span>install gulp</Span> and 
also let's <span>install gulp-sass</span> which is a <Span>plugin of gulp</Span>, you can actually 
<span>install multiple stuff with one command</span>, at the end we are also gonna use the 
<Span>--save-dev flag</Span> to let it know we want to <Span>install it as a dev-dependency</Span>, 
this <Span>flag</Span> can be <Span>added after</Span> or <Span>before</Span> you <Span>type the packages names</Span>,
like this: <Span>npm gulp gulp-sass --save-dev</Span> or this: <Span>npm --save-dev gulp gulp-sass</Span>.</p>

<p>After I <Span>installed the packages</Span> the <Span>package.json</Span> was <Span>updated</Span>, and we can now 
see that <Span>gulp and gulp-sass</Span> were indeed <Span>installed</Span> as <Span>dev-dependencies</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm15.png">

<p>If we now <Span>removed the modules and package-lock.json</Span> like before, we could use the 
<Span>npm install --production</Span> command and only the <Span>regular dependencies</Span> would be downloaded 
without the <Span>dev-dependencies</Span> if you wanted to <Span>install both</Span> you can still just type 
<Span>npm install</Span>, let's try this:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm16.png">

<p>As you can see, only <Span>two packages</Span> were <Span>installed</Span>.</p>

<p>To <Span>uninstall dependencies</Span> you have to use the <span>npm uninstall</span> command, to 
<Span>uninstall a dev-dependency</Span> you also need to <Span>add the --save-dev</Span> flag or else it 
will be <Span>uninstalled from modules</Span> but will <Span>remain in dev-dependencies</Span> inside the 
<Span>package.json</Span>. Let's <Span>uninstall gulp and gulp-sass dev-dependencies</Span> now:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm17.png">

<p>There are also a few <Span>alternatives to uninstall command</Span>, you can also use <span>remove</span>, 
<Span>rm</Span> or even <span>un</span> to <Span>uninstall packages</Span>, but <Span>uninstall</Span> is just 
easier to remember.</p>

<h2><u>Versioning:</u></h2>

<p>If you want to <span>install</span> a <Span>specific version of a package</Span> you can write
<Span>npm install package@version</Span>. To <Span>update</Span> the <Span>version</Span> you 
can write <Span>npm update package</Span>, let's try this out:</p>

<p>First, lets download one of the <Span>earlier versions</Span> of 
<Span>lodash</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm18.png">

<p>Now, let's <Span>update</Span> it to it's <Span>newer version</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm19.png">

<p>Let's talk a little about the <Span>version numbers</Span> and what 
is <Span>each number</Span> used for:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm20.png">

<p>Usually the <Span>last number</Span> is <Span>increased</Span> when 
a <Span>bug is fixed</Span> so <Span>updating that</Span> is safe, since there 
won't be any major changes that could break your code. The <Span>middle number</Span>
is <Span>increased</Span> when a <Span>new feature is added</Span> and it's 
<span>also safe to update</span> since no major changes that could break your code are 
added. The <Span>first number</Span> is <Span>increased</Span> when a 
<Span>major change</Span> happens, and it is <Span>unsafe to update</Span> since 
<Span>it could break your code</Span>.</p>

<p>Alright, so now, I want you to look at the <Span>image above</Span> and notice that 
little <Span>^ symbol</Span> that is <Span>infront the version numbers</Span>, what does that mean? Before, I 
talked about how you can <Span>share your package.json file</Span> and people can use 
<Span>npm install</Span> to <Span>download all dependencies</Span>, the <Span>carrot symbol</Span> indicates 
that the <Span>latest minor version should be installed</Span>, the <Span>first number of the version</Span> 
will <Span>always be the same</Span>, but the <Span>two others can be increased</Span>. If 
we added the <Span>~ symbol instead</Span> that would indicate that the <Span>lates patch version should be installed</Span>
and the <Span>major and minor versions would stay the same</Span>. If you 
<Span>didn't use any symbol</Span> then that would mean you want the <Span>exact version to be installed</Span> and 
lastly, if you <Span>replace the version with the * symbol</Span> that indicates that 
<Span>the latest version should be installed</Span>.</p>

<h2><u>Local & global packages:</u></h2>

<p>All the <Span>packages</Span> we have <span>installed</span> till now 
were <Span>installed</Span> locally, meaning they were <Span>added inside the node_modules folder</Span> in 
our <Span>project's folder</Span>, but what are <Span>global packages</Span>? A good example of a 
<Span>global package</Span> is the <Span>live-server package</Span> which <Span>reloads your browser</Span>
every time you <Span>update your files</Span>. To <Span>install a package globally</Span> you 
should use the <Span>-g flag</Span>. Let's try to <Span>install</Span> it then:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm21.png">

<p>Since it is <Span>global</Span> it <Span>isn't gonna go inside</Span> our 
<Span>node_modules folder</Span> and it's not gonna be added in 
<Span>package.json dependencies</Span>, it is being <Span>installed</Span> on 
our <Span>computer</Span>. If you want to know <Span>where your global modules are</Span> you 
can use <Span>npm root -g</Span> command, like this:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm22.png">

<p>You can view the <Span>file</Span> too, as you can see, I only have 
<Span>one package</Span> installed in my computer:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm23.png">

<p>So, since it is a <Span>local package</Span> we can actually <Span>run it from anywhere</Span>
but generally you wanna run it inside an <span>application directory</span>, let's try it, we are 
also gonna need an <Span>html file</Span> so that you can actually display things on the screen:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm24.png">

<p>If you want to <Span>uninstall a global package</Span> you can do that just like 
I said before, but you should also use the <Span>-g flag</Span>, like this: 
<span>npm uninstall live-server -g</span></p>

<h2><u>Listing packages:</u></h2>

<p>If you want to <Span>list all the dependencies</Span> of your 
<Span>project</Span> you can use <Span>npm list</Span> command:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm25.png">

<p>Let me <Span>install gulp</Span> now really quick, to show you something, 
<Span>gulp</Span> actually has a lot of <Span>dependencies</Span> of it's own, and 
many of it's <Span>dependencies</Span> have <span>other dependencies</span>, and so on,
so take a look to the <span>list</span> with <span>gulp</span> inside:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm26.png">

<p>As you can see, there is some kind of <Span>chain of dependencies</Span>, 
and they are a lot. So, how could we only <span>list the top level</span> of <Span>dependencies</Span>? 
If for example we <Span>only wanted to see our project's dependencies</Span>? To do that 
we could use the <Span>--depth flag</Span>, for example, if we only wanted to 
<Span>list the top levet</Span> we could write <span>npm list --depth 0</span> and that 
would <span>list the dependencies of with a depth of 0</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm27.png">

<p>If we also wanted to <Span>list the dependencies of our project's dependencies</Span> we could 
<Span>set the depth to 1</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm28.png">

<h2><u>NPM Scripts:</u></h2>

<p>Last thing I want to talk about are <Span>scripts</Span>, so, if you take 
a look into the <span>package.json</span> you can see there is an <Span>object</Span> called 
<Span>scripts</Span>. There you can create <Span>custom commands</Span>, for example, 
I could write <Span>"greet": "node index.js"</Span> and whenever I wrote 
<Span>npm run greet</Span> on my <Span>terminal</Span> the <Span>index.js would execute</Span>, 
let's try this:</p>

<p>In the <Span>index.js</Span> I'm gonna write something simple, let's just write 
<Span>console.log('Hello World!')</Span>, then, I'm gonna create the <span>script</span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm29.png">

<p>Now, let's try to run the <Span>script</Span> in the <Span>terminal</Span>:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm30.png">

<p>There are also a few <Span>script names</Span> that <Span>do not require</Span> the 
word <Span>run</Span> in order to work, for example, <span>start</span> and <Span>test</Span> and 
probably a few more.</p>

<h2><u>Tutorial:</u></h2>

<p>Here is a really cool video that helped me a lot with <Span>Node Packet Manager</Span>, 
I recommend watching it, even though it's a little long:</p>

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jHDhaSSKmB0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h2><u>How to use NPM with bash:</u></h2>

<p>So, I just figured out how to use <Span>npm commands</Span> 
with <Span>bash</Span>, to do so, you will need to get 
<Span>Node</Span> on your <Span>Ubuntu</Span>, first 
you should <Span>install NVM</Span>, which stands for 
<Span>Node Version Manager</Span> and is a <Span>version manager for Node,js</Span>, 
to do that, we should use the following <Span>command</Span>: curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm31.png">

<p>After you do this, you should <span>restart your terminal</span> and then <Span>install Node LTS version</Span>
by using this <Span>nvm command</Span>: <Span>nvm install -lts</Span></p>

<img src="../images/for-npm32.png">

<p>After you have done that, you should be able to use <Span>npm commands</Span> without 
a problem, let's try this out:</p>

<img src="../images/for-npm33.png">

<p>If for some reason you <Span>don't have curl</Span>, which is
a <Span>bash script</Span> that lets you <Span>download files</Span>, 
then you should use the following command: <span>sudo apt-get install curl</span></p>

        <h1>Introduction to Module Bundlers</h1>
    </header>

    <p><span>Module bundlers</span> are <Span>tools</Span> that 
    <Span>frontend developers</Span> use to <span>bandle JavaScript modules</span>
into a <Span>single JavaScript file</Span> that can be <Span>executed in the browser</Span>.</p>

<p>Some <Span>modern module bundlers</Span> are <Span>webpack</Span>, <Span>rollup</Span>,
<Span>fusebox</Span> and <Span>parcel</Span>. I'm actually going to talk about 
<Span>parcel</Span> later in this page, because it's a pretty simple <Span>module bundler</Span>
to use, and I may also talk about <Span>webpack</Span> later, which also is pretty popular, 
probably more than <Span>parcel</Span> but it needs a little more effort to learn.</p>

<p><span>Module bundlers</span> are required because:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some browser do not support module system</li>
    <li>It helps you manage dependency relationship of your code, it 
        will load modules in dependency order for you
    </li>
    <li>It helps you to load your assets in dependency order, image asset, 
        css aset, etc
    </li>
</ul>

<p>To illustrate, imagine you are building a <Span>web application</Span>, 
which is made up of <Span>multiple JavaScript files</Span>. You add <span>JavaScript files</span>
into <Span>html</Span> via <Span>script tags</Span>:</p>

<Style>
    .code-example{
        margin: auto; 
        width: fit-content;
        background-color: #20212c;
        color: yellow;
        padding-right: 70px;
        box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px 1px #bd93f9;
        padding-left: 30px;
        padding-bottom: 30px;
    }
    .code-example div{
        overflow-wrap: break-word;
        white-space: pre-wrap;
        text-align: left;
    }
    .code-example span{
        background-color: unset;
    }
    .pink {
        color: #dc689f;
    }
    .blue {
        color: #51ba99;
    }
    .deep-blue{
        color: #28408b;
    }
    .green {
        color: #47fa7b; 
    }
    .white {
        color: #c2cccc;
    }
</Style>

<div class="code-example">
<div>
&lt;<span class="pink">html</span>>
    &lt;<span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/src/foo.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
    &lt;<Span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/src/bar.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
    &lt;<Span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/src/baz.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
    &lt;<Span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/src/qux.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
    &lt;<Span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/src/quux.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
&lt;<span class="pink">/html</span>>
</div>
</div>

<p>Each <Span>file</Span> requires a <Span>seperate http requests</Span>, 
which is 5 round trip requests in order to get your <Span>application</Span> started. 
So it would be better if you can <Span>combine all five files</Span> into 
<Span>one single file</Span>:</p>

<div class="code-example">
    <div>
    &lt;<span class="pink">html</span>>
    &lt;<Span class="pink">script src</span>="<Span class="blue">/dist/bundle.js</Span>"><span class="pink">&lt;/script</span>>
    &lt;<span class="pink">/html</span>>
    </div>
    </div>

<p>So how do we generate the <Span>dist/bundle.js</Span>?</p>

<p>Several <Span>challenges</Span> arise in the process:</p>

<ul>
   <li>How do we <strong>maintain the order</strong> of the "files" 
    to be included?
   </li>
   <li>How do we <Strong>prevent naming conflicts</Strong> between "files"?</li>
   <li>How do we determine any unused "file" within the bundle?</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these can be solved if we know the <Span>relationship</Span> 
among each <Span>files</Span>, such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Which file is depended on another?</li>
    <li>What are the interface exposed from a file?</li>
    <li>Which exposed interfaces are being used by another?</li>
</ul>

<p>These information can <Span>solve the challenges</Span> brought up. 
So, what we need is a <Span>declarative method</Span> to 
<Span>describe the relationship</Span> between <Span>files</Span>, which led us 
to the <Span>JavaScript Module System</Span>.</p>

<p><span>CommonJS</span> or <Span>ES6 Modules</Span> provide ways for us 
to <Span>specify what files</span> we are <span>depending on</Span>, and 
<Span>which of their interface</Span> we are <Span>using in our file</Span>.</p>

<div class="code-example">
    <div>
        <span class="deep-blue">// CommonJS</span>
        <span class="pink">const</span> <Span class="white">foo</Span> <Span class="blue">=</Span> <span class="green">require</span>('./foo');
        <Span class="white">module.exports = bar</Span>;

        <Span class="deep-blue"> ES6 Modules</Span>
        <Span class="pink">import</Span> <Span class="white">foo</Span> <Span class="pink">from</Span> './foo';
        <Span class="pink">export default</Span> <Span class="white">bar</Span>;
    </div>

        <h1>Parcel Module Bundler</h1>
    </header>

    <p><Span>Parcel</Span> is a <Span>web application bundler</Span>, 
    which <Span>bundles your application</Span>, so what it basically does is that 
    it takes all your <Span>JavaScript files</Span>, <span>HTML files</span>, 
    <Span>CSS files</Span>, any of those different type of files you have and 
    <Span>bundles them up</Span>, <Span>minifies them</Span> and <Span>puts them into a directory</Span>
    for you. Also, a really cool thing about <Span>parcel</Span> is that is 
makes your life even more easier, by doing <Span>automatic transforms</Span>, so 
basically, it will take your <Span>sass</Span> and <Span>convert it to CSS</Span> it will 
take your <Span>modules JavaScript</Span> and <Span>convert it to normal JavaScript</Span>, it will 
use <Span>Babel</Span> to <Span>transpile your JavaScript</Span> so that you can use all 
<Span>new feautures of JavaScript</Span> so that <Span>all browsers can use it</Span>. It does that, and a few more 
stuff, and all this with <Span>zero config code</Span>, you <Span>run one line of code</Span> and 
are ready to go, not like <span>webpack</span> which takes some time to set.</p>

<p>First thing I am gonna do is <Span>set up an NPM project</Span>, by writing 
<Span>npm init -y</Span> in my <Span>terminal</Span>, then I will 
<span>install parcel</span> by writing <span>npm install parcel-bundler --save-dev</span>. 
After that the very next thing I am gonna need is some basic <Span>project structure</Span> to use, 
I'm gonna put all my <Span>files</Span> inside a <Span>folder</Span> called <Span>src</Span>. Let's finish with the preparations 
so that we are ready to begin using <Span>parcel</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel1.png">

<p>So, the <Span>JavaScript files</Span> have some pretty simple code inside, on 
<Span>exports a function</Span>, the other <span>imports the function</span> and 
<Span>uses it</Span>, then this <Span>index.js file</Span> which is the 
<Span>file that imports the function</Span> is used inside <Span>index.html</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel2.png">

<p>To make things more interesting, let's also add a 
    <Span>CSS style sheet file</span> and an 
        <Span>image</Span> to our project:
</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel4.png">

<p>Alright, now, to <Span>bundle those files</Span> we are gonna create 
<Span>two NPM scripts</Span>, you don't really need to create them, 
it's for organization porpuses, so that I don't have to 
hand write the <Span>commands</span> every time I want to run them, the <Span>first script</Span> will 
simple run <Span>parcel src/index.html</Span> and the 
<Span>second script</Span> will run <Span>parcel build src/index.html</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel3.png">

<p>Now, all I really have to do is type <Span>npm run dev</Span> and 
a <Span>folder</Span> with all my <Span>files bundled together</Span> will be created, 
with just one command, couldn't be any simplier. However, there is a chance, you may 
get some <Span>errors</Span>, like I did:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel5.png">


<p>As usual, I get errors, like I always do, so annoying, anyway, I did my 
    research, which took some time, and I found a solution, there are actually 
    <Span>two solutions</Span>, one is to <Span>revert back to version 1.12.3 of parcel</Span>
    or to <Span>update to version 2 of Parcel</Span>. To <Span>revert back to version 1.12.3</Span> you 
    should <Span>uninstall parcel</Span> and then type <Span>npm i parcel-bundler@1.12.3 --save-dev</Span> to 
    download the wanted version, to <Span>update to version 2</Span> you should write 
    <Span>npm i parcel@next --save-dev</Span>.
</p>

<p>After you have fixed the problem, everything should work fine:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel6.png">

<p>After you do this, you can <Span>click at the http link</Span> 
and your <Span>page</Span> will <Span>open in a local server</Span>. 
Another cool thing is that whenever 
you <Span>update your files in src folder</Span> the <Span>files in dist folder</Span> 
will <Span>also be updated</Span> automatically and your 
<Span>local server</Span> will <Span>reload</Span>, just like how 
<Span>online-server</Span> does.</p>

<P>If you want to import <span>Sass</span> you should 
<Span>import it</Span> through <Span>JavaScript</Span> and not 
thorugh <Span>HTML</Span>, then <Span>parcel</Span> will do it's magic 
and <Span>convert sass to CSS</Span>, let's try this:</P>

<p>First, let's change our files to <Span>import SASS</Span> instead 
of <Span>CSS</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel7.png">

<p>Now let's <Span>bundle the files</Span> again:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel8.png">

<p>Let's now press on the <Span>link</Span> to open the 
<Span>local server</Span> that was created for us to do 
our <Span>developing</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel9.png">

<p>The background may seem white, but it is indeed <Span>lightcyan</Span>, I should had used a more obvious color I guess but I didn't because I'm stupid.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main reason I ended up learning about <span>parcel</span> in the first place 
was because I needed to to use <span>packages</span> on the <Span>browser</Span>, because without 
it I was getting <Span>errors</Span>, so let's try <Span>installing moment package</Span> 
really quick:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel10.png">

<p>So, something I want to mention is that as you can see, 
<Span>Sass</Span> has also been <Span>installed</Span> in my 
<Span>dev-dependencies</Span>, it was actually <Span>automatically installed</Span>
by <Span>parcel</Span>, and that's just so cool and I wanted to mention it, anyway. 
Let's now continue and write some code to actually use <Span>moment package</Span>:

<img src="./../images/parcel11.png">

<p>Normally, if I had just opened the <Span>index.html</Span> on a 
<Span>live server</Span> without <span>bundling the files</span> using 
<Span>parcel</Span>, you would get an error, for my case at least, the 
<Span>module can't be found</Span>, from what I understand, 
the <Span>browser</Span> expects you to give it a <Span>file path</Span>, while 
you are trying to access the <span>module</span> through <Span>NPM</Span>, and somehow 
<Span>pascel</Span> takes care of this problem for you, here is the 
<span>error</span> I got without using <span>pascel</span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel12.png">

<p>When opened in the <Span>local server</Span> made by 
<Span>pascel</Span> however everything worked just fine:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel13.png">

<p>Alright, there is still one problem to discuss, we are only able to 
    view the page through that <Span>local server</Span>, if we were to 
    try and <Span>access the index.html file</Span> from inside the <Span>dist folder</Span> 
    see what would happen:
</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel14.png">

<p>After doing my research, I discovered the probem behind this 
    weird behaviour, if you check your <Span>HTML document</Span>
    inside the <Span>dist folder</Span> you will see that the <Span>paths of the files</Span>
    are <Span>absolute</Span>:
</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel17.png">

<p>To fix that, you should use <Span>relative paths</Span>, which you 
can do by either <Span>removing the backslash</Span> or <Span>addint a dot before the backslash</Span>. 
Doing that on your own however is time consuming, so we are gonna add 
the following <Span>flag</Span> to the <Span>parcel commands</Span> inside your 
<Span>scripts</Span>: <Span>--public-url ./</Span>. This will make the 
src paths <Span>relative</Span> rather than <Span>absolute</Span>:
</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel16.png">

<p>So now, what exactly does the <Span>build command</Span> do? It basically 
<Span>minifies the files</Span> to <Span>take less space</Span>, but when used they will 
<Span>no longer automatically update</Span>, so that's why I recommend using the 
<Span>prod script</Span> only after you are done <Span>developing</Span> the files.</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel15.png">

<p>What if you didn't want to create the <Span>bundled files</Span> inside 
the <Span>dist folder</Span>? What if you wanted to use a 
<Span>custom folder</Span>? You can do that by using the 
<Span>--out-dir path</Span> flag, let's create a <Span>folder</Span> called 
<Span>bundled-files</Span> and use it to <Span>store our bundled files</Span>:</p>

<img src="./../images/parcel18.png">

<p>Here is a really cool tutorial you can watch, in my notes I included some more information 
    that were not included in the video abou thow some bugs can be fixed, but in the video you will 
    also learn about how you can add plugins if you want to, I don't really care about plugins at 
    the moment, getting it to work was all I needed so that's why I didn't go more in depth.

        <h1>dat.GUI API package:</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I think, now that I finally know how to 
    <Span>install packages</Span> and 
    <Span>make them work in browser</Span> I should 
    try <Span>using one</Span> for real, and that's what 
    we are gonna do in this section, I wanted to 
    learn to use a <Span>package</Span> called 
    <Span>dat.GUI API</Span> because it seems pretty 
    useful for <Span>animations</Span>, and I'm 
    currently learning <Span>canvas animations</Span>, 
    and this <Span>package</Span> was actually the reason 
    I ended up learning about <Span>terminal</Span>, 
    <Span>NPM</Span>, <Span>module bundlers</Span> and all 
    those stuff in the first place.
    </p>

    <p>This <Span>package</Span> creates a 
    <Span>square</Span> on your <Span>screen</Span> 
    in which you can <Span>add variables inside</Span>
    to be able and <Span>change them</Span> without having 
    to do so <span>through code</span>, which would take time. 
    The best feauture I believe is that it even 
    lets you set a <Span>range of numbers</Span> that 
    can be set on a <Span>variable</Span>, which creates 
    a <Span>scroll bar</Span> you can use, which means you don't 
    even need to <Span>type the values</Span> with 
this <Span>package</Span>.</p>

<P>First thing I will do is <Span>initialize NPM</Span>, 
then I will <Span>install parcel globally</Span>, since 
I want to be able to use it on multiple projects from now on, 
and then I will <Span>instal dat.gui</Span>:</P>

<img src="./../images/dat1.png">

<p>So, now, if I were to <span>create a JavaScript file</span> 
and use it on <Span>this page you are currently viewing</Span>, if 
I <Span>bundled this page</Span>, a mess would be created, it would 
<Span>bundle all the images</Span>, and <Span>js files</Span> that 
are being <Span>referenced in the page</Span>. To avoid that I am only going to 
<Span>bundle the JavaScript file</Span> and <Span>link the bundled JavaScript file</Span>
to this page:

<img src="./../images/dat.png">

<p>After I <Span>run the dev script</Span>, the <Span>example.js file</Span> should be 
<Span>bundled</Span> and <Span>placed inside the bundled-files folder</Span>, 
now we can <Span>reference the bundled example.js file</Span> inside 
a <Span>script element</Span> in our <Span>HTML document</Span> and it should work.</p>


<p>I will now <Span>reference the bundled example.js file</Span> to 
<Span>this page</Span>, then I can edit the <Span>original example.js file</Span>
and it <Span>will automatically update the bundled file too</Span>:</p>

<script src="./../CSS-JavaScript-External-Files/dat/dat-example.12a7016c.js">
</script>

<img src="./../images/dat3.png">

<p>From now on, I will be writing the <Span>code</Span> I want to 
write inside the <Span>example.js</Span> file, which will <Span>automatically update</Span>
the <Span>bundled example.js file</Span>, so, let's make a button that 
<Span>activates the package</Span>, so that it is not open from the time you enter 
the page:</p>

<p class="left">[example.js] JavaScript Code:</p>

<p class="left"><Span class="code10">import * as dat from 'dat.gui'

window.addEventListener('load', (e)=>{
    let button = document.getElementById('dat-button');

    var gui;

    button.addEventListener('click', (e)=>{
        let div = document.querySelector('.close-button');
        if(div == null){
            gui = new dat.GUI();
        } else {
            gui = undefined;
            div.remove();
        }
    });
});</Span></p>

<p class="left">Outcome:</p>

<p class="left"><button id="dat-button">Click Me!</button></p>

<p>Let's try to create a simple project now, we are gonna use 
the <Span>gui.add(object, 'property', min, max)</Span> method to 
<Span>add variables</Span>, the <Span>last two paremeters</Span> are 
<Span>optional</Span>, if you don't add them you will simple have 
to <Span>type in the values</Span>, if you use them 
there will be a <Span>scroll bar you can drag</Span>.</p>

<p>If you want to <span>seperate variables</span> in 
<Span>folders</Span>, you can write <span>let folder = gui.addFolder('name')</span>
and then use the <Span>add method</Span> to <Span>the wanted folder</Span>, 
like this: <Span>folder.add(object, 'proeprty', min, max)</Span></p>

<p>Alright, so, I did some <span>extra things</span>, like, I 
<Span>changed the background color of the rows</Span> to make the 
<span>font easier to read</span>, and I also figured out since I'm 
<Span>making folders</Span> I have to <Span>also remove them</Span> when 
<Span>clicked to close</Span>, to find out what the <Span>element's classes were</Span> 
I simple <Span>inspected the page on browser</Span> and used the <Span>chrome tool</Span>
that lets me <Span>click in an element to choose it</Span>.</p>

<p>Anyway, now that we made our project, let's <Span>build the application</Span>, this 
simple will <Span>minimies the files</Span> to <Span>take less space</Span> by 
<Span>removing spaces in code</Span> and stuff like that:</p>

<img src="./../images/dat5.png">

<p>After that, we no longer need the <Span>original example.js</Span> we 
can just remove it or keep it for later use, then we can place our <Span>bundled
file</Span> anywhere we like an use it:</p>

<header><h1><u>How to use Grunt task runner</u></h1></header>
<h2>What is a task runner?</h2>
<p>A task runner can perform repetitive tasks for you, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prefixing CSS rules</li>
    <li>Compiling SASS files into CSS</li>
    <li>Minifying JS / CSS files</li>
    <li>Concatenating Files</li>
</ul>
<p>The most popular task runners out there at the moment are Grunt and Gulp, however
in this section we will learn about Grunt.</p>
<h2>How to install Grunt.js?</h2>
<p>To install Grunt we are gonna use Node Package Manager, and there are few
things you need to do before you are ready to start using it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Install grunt-cli globally</li>
    <li>Create a package.json file in your project</li>
    <li>Install grunt locally</li>
    <li>Create a Gruntfile.js</li>
    <li>Install plugins</li>
</ul>
<p>The grunt-cli is the grunt command line interface which will allow us to
use grunt commands in our terminal. The grunt we install locally is like a package,
we will import it in oru file to use grunt inside our Gruntfile.js. I will talk about how to install and use
plugins later in the section.</p>

<p>So, let's first download grunt-cli globally, to do so we will write in our terminal
the following command: <strong>npm install grunt-cli -g</strong></p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt1.PNG">

<p>Because we installed this globally we will be able to now use
grunt commands in our terminall any time from anywhere so there won't be the
need to install it again when creating other projects.</p>

<p>Let's now create a quick project folder, create a package.json file and install
grunt locally. Firstly, to create the package.json file we will write npm init, like I have
explained before in NPM section:</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt2.PNG">

<p>Now to install grunt you can simple write: <strong>npm install grunt --save-dev</strong></p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt3.PNG">

<p>Alright, we are almost done with the preparations all that's left now
is to create a Gruntfile.js file, there we will write our grunt code later:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt4.PNG">

<h2>Creating a Gruntfile.js:</h2>

<p>So, let's start by creating the basic structure of the file before
we start filling it with stuff:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt5.PNG">

<p>So, grunt is basically just a module at the end of the day, so we have
to export it with Node.js. The function we export is split in three sections,
configuration, plugins and tasks, you will unerstand how
they work and interact with each other later.
</p>
<p>As you can see, I added one task called run, let's try running it:</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt6.PNG">

<p>It worked, it also threw a little warning because of the plugin example but don't mind it.</p>

<p>So, now I used a function inside the registerTask method
but this could also be a reference to a configuration or
even an array, using an array you can run multiple tasks like this:
</p>

<p class='left'><span class='code10'>module.exports = function(grunt){

<span class="gray">    // Configuration</span>
    grunt.initConfig({
<span class="gray">        // pass in options to plugins, references to files etc</span>
    });

<span class="gray">    // Load plugins
    //grunt.loadNpmTasks('plugin-name');</span>

<span class="gray">    // Register tasks</span>
    grunt.registerTask('run', function(){
        console.log('I am running');
    });

    grunt.registerTask('sleep', function(){
        console.log('I am sleeping');
    });

    grunt.registerTask('all', ['sleep', 'run']);c

}</span></p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt7.PNG">

<header><h1>How to use plugins:</h1></header>

<p>Let's now learn how to add and use plugins inside the 
    Gruntfile. First thng you need to do is to find a plugin
    you want to use in grunt web page: 
    <a href='https://gruntjs.com/plugins' target='_blank'>https://gruntjs.com/plugins</a>
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt8.PNG" style="width: 60%;">

<p>Officially maintained "contrib" plugins are marked with a star icon, so those should be 
    preferred. For this example I will use concat plugin, which basically can be used to
    merge multiple files into one new file and can be very useful when working on big 
    projects.
</p>

<p>Usually all good plugins will have instructions of how to install them and use them in the 
    gruntjs webpage, as ou can see here are the installation instructionsfor 
    concat plugin:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt9.PNG" style="width: 50%;">

<p>So, first you install the plugin locally with NPM and then you add it in your Gruntfile so that you can
then use it as you like. Naturally, there are well detailed instructions of how it's used in 
the webpage but I will create an example here to show you how a Gruntfile truly works.</p>

<p>For the sake of our examples let's create some files first:</p>
<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt10.PNG" >

<p>Concat plugin is fairly easy to use, here is an example:</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt12.PNG" >

<p>So, this is what the syntax for this specific plugin looks like,
    concat property lets grunt know you are adding options for the concat plugin,
    then you can add tasks you want to be done, for example, in my 
    case I wanted to concat css and js files, the names of those properties 
    however are optional, and you can have as many as you like,
    lastly inside those properties go objects with src and dest properties
    to let grunt know what files to concat and where, you can add 
    them one by one in an array, or if you want to select all files of
a kind writing '*.js' or '*.css' will do just that.</p>
<p>The destination file will be created by grunt if it doesn't already exist, to 
    run those tasks you can simple write grunt concat in your terminal:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt11.PNG" >

<p>You can also run only one of the tasks if you want by specifying the 
    task like this: 
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt13.PNG" >

<p>Or you could reference them in custom tasks:</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt14.PNG" >

<p>Anyway, here is a video that explains this section in more detail:</p>

<iframe width="1350" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7g6jJu2yq7g?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j85fkVyCzCMJDfteLtrl_y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<h1>How to compile SASS into CSS with grunt:</h1>

<p>So, just like before we are going to install a plugin, grunt-contrib-sass is
the first officially maintained plugin you will see however in order for it to work we 
need to install ruby to our computer. To avoid that because I'm lazy and want the job to be done quickly
and simple we are going to install another plugin called grunt-sass.
</p>

<p>The grunt-sass plugin uses Node Sass or Dart Sass packages to compile SASS so we need to install one of those in our project 
as well with NPM, we will install Node Sass for this example, to install both this and grunt-sass plugin we can write the 
following command in our terminal: npm install --save-dev node-sass grunt-sass
</p>

<p>After installation is complete, check your package.json file 
to confirm that everything is installed:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt15.PNG" >

<p>Let me show you an example of how it works now:</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt16.PNG" style="width: 50%;">

<p>So, let's talk about options property first, inside it we
can choose wether we use Dart Sass or Node Sass by passing 
the module to the implementation option. One implementation or the other must be passed.
</p>

<p>Now, about source maps, basically they are files that allow the browser to map 
CSS generated by a pre-processor, such as Sass, back to the original source 
file, including exactly which Sass mixin, placeholder or variable is responsible for a given line of CSS.
Those are useful for DevTools that let you live-edit your preprocessor source files in the Sources panel, 
and view the results without having to leave DevTools or refresh the page. When you inspect 
an element whose styles are provided by a generated CSS file, the Elements panel displays a 
link to the original source file, not the generated .css file. We don't care 
about all that at the moment however so we leave it as false.</p>

<p>The build property is a task, you can have as many tasks you want and name 
them however you like, a task should be an object with a property called files, inside 
the files property should be an array of objects with src, dest properties, src is used to select a 
file and dest is used to select the place it should be compiled, very similar to concat 
plugin but you can only pass one file in the src property.
</p>

<p>So, now let's combine concat and sass plugins and make a cool task to 
do everything at once:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt17.PNG" style="width: 60%;">

<h1>How to uglify JavaScript</h1>

<p>To 'uglify' a JavaScript file is to minify it using Uglify. 
Uglification improves performance while reducing readability.
This however isn't all, when we uglify a JavaScript it will 
also bundle our file, so, if for example it requires code from other JavaScript
files this code will automatically be added to our uglified file 
so that the performance is improved, since no server requests will need to be made.</p>

<p>As expected we will use a plugin to do that, the grunt-contrib-uglify plugin,
to install it simple write npm install grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev, the way this 
plugin works is similar to grunt-sass plugin so instead of explaining it to you let 
me show you:
</p>

<img class="image" src="./../images/grunt18.PNG" style="width: 70%;">

<p>You can also add an options property but for more details 
about this you can visit grunt website: <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify' target="_blank">https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-uglify</a>
