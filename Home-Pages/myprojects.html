<h1>My notes:</h1>
<p> My best project, and most useful project, remembering everything is hard, 
    really, memorizing stuff is good, but programming isn't about memorizing, programming 
is about understanding, google is always there to help you whenever you forget the 
syntax, and keeping notes is also very good, because it saves you a lot of time 
when you need to remember something you have forgot. Except from that, I can put here
useful sources that helped me, videos, etc, and it also helps me a lot at learning 
new stuff, because I get to write down what I learn, create examples and explain how 
things work, that really helps me learn. </p>

<h1> SVG sun and earth animation </h1>

<p> Not very hard to make, I used animateTransform element to make the earth rotate around the sun.

<h1> SVG colored heart animation </h1>

<p> This one was a little hard to make, the animation
it self wasn't hard, not if you understand it at least, it was the heart
I had to draw using curves that took me a while.

<hr>

<h1> Dancing Circles animation </h1>

<p> This one was pretty easy to animate as well, just like the heart, once
you understand the way it works its not hard at all, all I had to do was
create two animated circles, make them a group, and then use this group as many
times as I liked, and use the x and y attributes to move each circle to 
different places.

<h1> Animated Fans </h1>

try out animating grouped objects.

<h1> Just Keep Going SVG animation</h1>

<p> It took me a while to make this one, it had a lot of curves and stuff, it was tiring, but I enjoyed it, I saw a similar one in youtube and decided to try and remake it, it's not as good as the original, but its fine I believe, and I'm still a beginner after all, if I were to make it again I'm sure it would come out better. </p>

<h1> Escape Room game</h1>

<p> This was made with only SVG, I wanted to try out some of my ideas, to see
if it is possible to actually make a game without using JavaScript at all, and as I thought, it is indeed possible, but hard, and can't get very flexible. </p>

<h1> Bee Boss Battle game</h1>

<h1> Some school homework I had </h1>

<p>It's some school homework I did for school. We aren't learning web development in 
    my school sadly, instead they are teaching us some stupid educational language
    written in greek characters. Last time they gave us some homework and we were supposed 
    to create algorithms and solve some problems, however, the instructions of our 
    homework never mentioned which language should be used to create those algorithms, 
    and since the educational language we are learning can't even be read by computers I decided 
    to use JavaScript and truly create those programs. I'm not studying web development for 
    the past five months so that I write code in fake languages after all. This project 
    is written in my native language, since the homework required it.

<h1> JavaScript Clock </h1>

<p>A clock I created using JavaScript and CSS, it was a nice project, I didn't 
    come up with the idea all by my self, I watched a YouTube tutorial, studied it, understood it completely 
    and then tried and remade it on my own.

<h1> JavaScript rotate towards cursor/touch </h1>

<p> 
In order to make this project I needed to study 
vectors, so that I can find the angle based 
onn the cursor/touch position, it was a nice project, 
but it took me a while to make due to some problems 
I faced during the process. I truly believe this 
project helped me become a better developer, 
knowing how to work with vectors is very useful.

<h1> JavaScript face that looks towards cursor/touch </h1>

<p> 
A face that looks whevever you move your cursor or 
finger if you are using a touch screen. It works pretty 
similarly to the rotation project I made before.

<h1>Drag and Drop list for mouse/touch</h1>

<p>A drag and drop list hat is made to work for both 
mouse users and touch screen users, it took me a while to make.

<h1>Canvas mouse/touch effect project</h1>

<p>This is a canvas project I made, it took me a while to make because 
    of some problems I faced, however, I managed to get it done, it supports 
    multi-touches too.

<h1>Canvas gravity effect</h1>

<p>This is a canvas project I made in which I tried to create the effect 
    of gravity, it took me a while but I enjoyed it and at the end the results 
    were pretty well. This project has surely helped me improve my canvas skills.

<h1>Canvas collision effect</h1>

<p>In order to create this one I had to learn the physics of elastic collisions,
I really wish I had paid more attention in school when we studied those stuff, at the end 
I did manage to understand it, but because the particles were moving on both x and y directions 
calculating the velocity after the collision was a little more complicated since I had to rotate the axes 
and do some math. At the end I got the wanted result, and here is the outcome:

<h1>Canvas particles move around the cursor</h1>

<p>This was a fun project I made which I also currently use on the home page of my notes.
In order to create that I needed to learn how to make circular movements while animating 
the canvas and there were a bunch of other stuff I needed too such as pixel manipulation to 
create the trail effect and a bunch of other math and JavaScript skills.

<h1>Canvas fireworks</h1>

<p>To make this project I used circular motions, gravity, trail, 
it basically was a project which required me to make use of a lot of previous knowledge 
I had gained and it was very good practice.

<h1>Audio custom controls</h1>

<p>I made this project in order to better understand how the 
audio object works, and also, it was something I always wanted to 
learn to do from when I first started learning web development,
so it is nice that I have finally reached the point that making things 
like these is actually possible.

<h1>Torn-Like Particle Tunnels</h1>

<h1>DON'T DO DRUGS (my first canvas game)</h1>

<h1>Pixels Rain</h1>

<p>It's particles falling line rain forming an image, to make this I made use
of the pixel array, I first scanned the image, and created a mapped array that cotains
information such as brightness and color, I made it so in that array I can easily access
pixels based on their x and y positions, then I used that mapped pixel array to
make particles that move on the screen change speed based on the brightness and also be colored,
the brightness and color are given to each particle based on it's position on the canvas.
