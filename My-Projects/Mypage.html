<p align = "center"> Hello, I'm Karak10 and few days ago I decided to learn HTML in order to maybe 
one day I be able to get a job as a web developer. I have been studying HTML for a week now 
with the help of SoloLearn, its not the best app, they could have done the courses better but 
I have indeed learned a lot the past week, I'm even able to make a website like the one you are reading now.
I am making this site in order to practice, its a project I was suggested to make by SoloLearn
at the end of the course, through this site I will be using pretty much everything I have
learned by now.</p>
